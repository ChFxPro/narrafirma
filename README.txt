==== NarraFirma Trademark Usage Policy

NarraFirma is a trademark of Cynthia F. Kurtz and is used by permission for the main distribution of this software.

Cynthia F. Kurtz owns and oversees the trademarks for the NarraFirma name and logo. We have developed this trademark usage policy with the following goals in mind:

    We’d like to make it easy for anyone to use theNarraFirma name or logo for community-oriented efforts that help spread and improve NarraFirma.
    We’d like to make it clear how NarraFirma-related businesses and projects can (and cannot) use the NarraFirma name and logo.
    We’d like to make it hard for anyone to use the NarraFirma name and logo to unfairly profit from, trick or confuse people who are looking for official NarraFirma resources.

Permission from Cynthia F. Kurtz is required to use the NarraFirma name or logo as part of any project, product, service, domain or company name.

We will grant permission to use the NarraFirma name and logo for projects that meet the following criteria:

    The primary purpose of your project is to promote the spread and improvement of the NarraFirma software. This includes creating versions of NarraFirma hosted on GitHub and which clearly represent the origins and original authorship of the software (inlcuding a link back to the main narrafirma.com site) and which are substantially similar in purpose and scope.

    Your project is non-commercial in nature (it can make money to cover its costs or contribute to non-profit entities, but it cannot be run as a for-profit project or business).

    Your project neither promotes nor is associated with entities that currently fail to comply with the GPL license under which NarraFirma is distributed.

If your project meets these criteria, you will be permitted to use the NarraFirma name and logo to promote your project in any way you see fit with one exception: Please do not use NarraFirma as part of a domain name. Examples of projects in this category are international NarraFirma communities that are dedicated to the translation and distribution of NarraFirma in their respective countries.

All other NarraFirma-related businesses or projects can use the NarraFirma name and logo to refer to and explain their services, but they cannot use them as part of a product, project, service, domain, or company name and they cannot use them in any way that suggests an affiliation with or endorsement by Cynthia F. Kurtz or the NarraFirma open source project.

For example, a consulting company can describe its business as “123 Web Services, offering NarraFirma consulting for small businesses,” but cannot call its business “The NarraFirma Consulting Company.”

Similarly, it’s OK to use the NarraFirma logo as part of a page that describes your products or services, but it is not OK to use it as part of your company or product logo or branding itself. Under no circumstances is it permitted to use NarraFirma as part of a top-level domain name.

We do not allow the use of the trademark in advertising, including AdSense/AdWords.

Please note that it is not the goal of this policy to limit commercial activity around NarraFirma. We encourage NarraFirma-based businesses.

When in doubt about your use of the NarraFirma name or logo, please contact Cynthia F. Kurtz for clarification.

Other permissions to use the NarraFirma trademark will need to be obtained specifically in writing.
