<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
What is participatory narrative inquiry?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Participatory narrative inquiry (PNI) is an approach in which groups of people participate in gathering and working with raw stories of personal experience in order to make sense of complex situations for better decision making. PNI focuses on the profound consideration of values, beliefs, feelings, and perspectives through the
recounting and interpretation of lived experience. PNI draws on theory and practice in narrative inquiry, participatory action research, oral history, mixed-methods research, participatory theatre, narrative therapy, sensemaking, complexity theory, and decision support.

<div class="question">
Where can I read more about participatory narrative inquiry?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
The NarraFirma&#0153; software is a companion to the book 
<em><a href="http://workingwithstories.org">Working with Stories in Your Community or Organization: Participatory Narrative Inquiry</a></em>
(WWS) by Cynthia F. Kurtz. WWS
describes the PNI process in full, so you can do PNI projects yourself. 
Cynthia wanted to write NarraFirma because readers of WWS kept asking her 
to help them get started doing PNI.
NarraFirma follows the book's instructions step by step,
incorporating many of its questions and suggestions. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
How does NarraFirma help with PNI projects?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
NarraFirma is designed to support people using the PNI approach step-by-step as described in the WWS book.
You can use NarraFirma to plan your Participatory Narrative Inquiry (PNI) project, decide how you will collect stories, write questions about stories, 
plan group story sessions (and record what went on in them), collect or enter stories (and answers to questions), 
look at patterns in collected stories and answers, build catalysis reports describing the patterns for use in sensemaking, 
plan sensemaking sessions (and record what went on in them), plan interventions (and record what went on in them), 
gather project feedback, reflect on the project, present the project to others, and preserve what you learned so you can use it on the next project.</p>
<p>You can read more about the ideas behind NarraFirma at <a href="http://www.narrafirma.com">narrafirma.com</a>.</p>

<div class="question">
When does NarraFirma save my data? Where is the Save button?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Any changes you make to any field in a project are normally saved immediately to the server and are relayed to other connected users of the same project.
However, if you are viewing a project in "Read only" mode, changes are only saved locally and will be lost when you reload the page or close your browser.
You can back up and restore a project (including changes made in "Read only" mode) using the "Import/Export" page in the Administration section.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Where do I put the stories?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
On the NarraFirma home page, click the <a href="../collection/help_page_collection.html">Collection</a> icon (or button). There you can collect stories over the internet or enter them by hand (from interviews or group story sessions). You'll need to create a <a href="help_page_glossary.html#storyform">story form</a> first. Story forms include questions that <a href="help_page_glossary.html#elicitingquestions">elicit</a> stories, questions about <a href="help_page_glossary.html#questionsaboutstories">stories</a>, and questions about <a href="help_page_glossary.html#elicitingquestions">people</a>. NarraFirma supports <a href="help_page_glossary.html#mixedmethodsresearch">mixed-methods research</a>, which means that you'll be looking both at the stories and at (counts of) answers to questions about them.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Can I search for text in stories?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Yes. Go to the "Review incoming stories" page, look at all of your collected stories, and use your browser to search for text in the table.  
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
How do I delete stories? 
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
See the help for the <a href="../collection/help_page_reviewIncomingStories.html">Review incoming stories</a> page for an explanation
of how stories are saved in NarraFirma and how you can ignore or remove them.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Does NarraFirma work only with story data?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
NarraFirma was designed to be used with stories. The stories can be brief anecdotes &mdash; in fact, that's usually the case. But in order for NarraFirma to work well for you, you do need to ask people to tell you <em>what happened</em> to them. If you don't have stories, you can use a variety of other software to collect and analyze data.
