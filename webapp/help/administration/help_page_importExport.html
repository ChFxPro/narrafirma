<div class="question">
Should I export a project snapshot or a project history?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
As you work in NarraFirma, the software saves every action you take using "messages" that together form a history. 
This is ground work in place for an undo system (which we have not yet implemented). 
A project snapshot does not include these messages; it simply saves the current state of each element in the project.
So at this moment it doesn't make any difference if you save a project snapshot or a project history, but in the future
it will matter.
</p>
</div>
		
<div class="question">
Why can't I save a project history without stories?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
A project history is a record of everything that took place since you started the project, including the addition of stories, changes to stories,
and references to stories. It would be hard (and possibly damaging to a potential future undo system) to pull the story-related messages out of that history.

<div class="question">
Can I use import and export to copy a project?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Yes. You can export the project (with or without collected stories) to a file, then create
a new, empty project and import the data into it.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Can I import a project on top of an existing project, to restore it to a previous state?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Don't do that. It will have unpredictable results. 
You should always import a project file to an empty project.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Is this the only way to save the stories I collected?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
No. You can export your stories, and your story forms, as CSV (spreadsheet) files from the
"Export stories or story forms" page in the "Collection" section of NarraFirma.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Can I use the export function to move or copy a project from a WordPress to a Node.js version of NarraFirma (or vice versa)?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Yes. The file format is independent of either back end. Just export the project, create a new (empty) project
in your other installation of NarraFirma, and import the project into it.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What is the export format?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Projects are exported in JSON format. You can open a project file in any browser and see the elements defined in it. 
</p>
</div>
		
<div class="question">
Can I use the export function to translate the entire project to another piece of software, like a word processor?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Sort of, but the better way is to go to the Administration-Print page and print a project report.
