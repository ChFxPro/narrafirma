<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
Can I open a project report in my word processor?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Yes. The HTML document uses CSS styles, and they are included in the file (instead of referencing an external CSS file),
so your word processor might be able to pick them up and use them as document styles. Even if the styles don't come out right,
you will still be able to edit and style the text manually.

</div>

<div class="question">
Can I print a project report, edit it, and then import it back into NarraFirma?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
No. Unlike an exported file, a printed report cannot be read by NarraFirma. It is for your use outside the program.
