<div class="question">
What's this about characters?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Sliders (ranges) are represented in story cards as rows of characters (letters). 
By default a slider looks like this:
</p>
<p>-----|--------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
If you like, you can change your sliders to use other characters and create displays like these:
</p>
<p>_____<>________________________________</p>
<p>.....тег.............................................</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|||~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>===========================[]===========================</p>
<p>
A few tips on changing slider characters:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Some characters are wider than others. If your before-the-button character 
		is wider than your after-the-button character, your slider values may appear
		different than they really are.
	</li>
	<li>White space is collapsed in HTML. This means you can use an empty space
		for your after-the-button character, but you can't use it before the button.
	</li>
	<li>You can use emojis and other special characters, 
		but whether your browser and printer will print
		them correctly is anybody's guess. See what works for you.
	</li>
</ul>

<div class="question">
How do I use the "Custom CSS" feature?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Click "Print Story Cards," 
then use your browser to <strong>inspect</strong> any element of your story cards you want to change. 
(The usual way to do this is to right-click on a word or area and choose "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" from the popup menu that appears.
If you don't see a popup menu or an "Inspect" menu item, look up how to inspect a web page element in the browser you are using.
Sometimes you need to turn on "developer" mode to inspect page elements.)
</p>
<p>When you have successfully inspected the page element you want to change, you should see its CSS class. 
	Most of the classes start with "narrafirma-story-card".
</p>
<p>Next go to the "custom CSS" field on the the "Print story cards" page and
write a class selector (label) and declaration (set of formatting lines)
for that class. 
For example, if you wanted all choice-question selections (drop-down list, checkboxes, radio buttons) to appear in blue, you would write a CSS statement
like this:
<code><br/><br/>
.narrafirma-story-card-select-selected, .narrafirma-story-card-checkboxes-selected, .narrafirma-story-card-radiobuttons-selected { <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; color: blue;<br/>
}<br/><br/>
</code>
<p>
Then reload your browser and print your story cards again to see your change. 
(You can't just reload the story cards page; you have to reload the NarraFirma application, then click the "Print Story Cards" button again.)
