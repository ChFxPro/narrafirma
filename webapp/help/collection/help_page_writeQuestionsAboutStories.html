<div class="page-title">Write questions about stories</div>
<div class="text">
<p>
Here is where you can write questions to ask people about their stories. You'll draw from these questions when you create your story forms.
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
Add some questions to your list. For each question, write what you want to ask people. Choose what type of question it is (see below for an explanation of the types). Also give each question a short name (so there's room to write the question name in tables and on graphs).
</p>
<p>
You can copy questions from built-in templates (suggestions). Change the blank spaces (_____) in the question to suit your project and participants.
</p>
<p>
For help choosing, click the "Recommendations for story questions" button. You'll see a table that shows the various options, color-coded with evaluations of risk, connected to the answers you gave to questions about your <a href="../planning/help_page_participantGroups.html">participant groups</a> and <a href="../planning/help_page_describeYourResources.html">resources</a>.

<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
Why ask questions about stories?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Asking questions helps people make sense of their own stories. These interpretations increase your project's breadth and depth of exploration, leading to deeper insights. When you ask not just "what happened" but "what does that <em>mean</em> to you," you've gone further and deeper in.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
How many questions should I ask about each story?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<ul>
<li>For a <strong>kiosk</strong> type project, in which people are just walking by and have no commitment to the project at all, you can ask <strong>three to five</strong> questions about each story.</li>
<li>For a <strong>volunteer</strong> type project, in which people feel socially obligated to participate, you can ask <strong>six to nine</strong> questions about each story.</li>
<li>For a <strong>commitment</strong> type project, in which people feel that participating is linked to their identities, you can ask <strong>ten to fifteen</strong> questions about each story.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="question">
How do I set the order of the questions?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
You don't set the question order here. You only create the questions here. You set the order of questions when you design your story form. That's so you can reuse your questions in multiple story forms.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Can I use HTML formatting for questions?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
You can use these HTML tags: address, article, b, big, blockquote, br, caption, cite, code, del, div, dd, d1, dt, em, 
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, hr, i, kbd, li, ol, p, pre, s, small, span, sup, sub, strong, strike, table, td, th, tr, u, ul.
</p>
<p>
You can also use a smaller subset of HTML tags (b, big, em, i, s, small, sup, sub, strong, strike, u) in your 
specified answers (choices) for checkboxes and radio buttons.
</p>
<p>
HTML tags affect how your question texts appear in your online survey and in the "Enter stories" screen. 
They are stripped out when you print your story form.
</p>
<p>
To protect your NarraFirma installation from hacking, you cannot use attributes (such as "id") on any of these tags.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What do the question types mean?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<ul>
<li>boolean: the options "yes" and "no" with radio buttons</li>
<li>label: just some plain text (not really a question; nothing gets stored)</li>
<li>header: some bold text (not really a question; nothing gets stored)</li>
<li>checkbox: one check box (unchecked by default)</li>
<li>checkboxes: any number of check boxes (multiple choice, all unchecked by default)</li>
<li>text: a one-line text box</li>
<li>textarea: a multi-line (and extendible) text box</li>
<li>select: a single-choice drop-down</li>
<li>radiobuttons: any number of radio buttons (single choice)</li>
<li>slider: a line with a button you drag, with labels on the left and right</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="question">
What's the difference between a "boolean" and a "check box"?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
A check box has only two possible answers: yes and no. It starts out unchecked, and you can't tell whether people meant to say "no" or didn't touch it. A boolean question, in contrast, has three possible answers: yes, no, and unanswered. It starts out with neither radio button clicked, and you can tell whether people clicked "no" or didn't click anything.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Can I create my own templates?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Only if you are comfortable editing the source code files in your installation of NarraFirma. If you are, find the file called "templates.js" and add your template to it. (Backup the file first!) Follow the formatting in the templates you see, and make sure you put your template in the right part of the file. If NarraFirma won't start up after you make your changes, check your browser's console to find out where the error lies.
