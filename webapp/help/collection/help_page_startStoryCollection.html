A story collection identifies a specific group of stories that were collected using a specific story form.
</p>
<p>
You can have multiple story collections within one project. 
For example, you might create a test collection for experimenting, 
a pilot collection with a draft story form, and a final story collection with a revised story form.
</p>
</div>

<h2 class="heading">What to do here</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>
To create a story collection, click <b>Add</b>, then give the new story collection a <b>name</b>. 
This name won't be visible to the people who only tell stories in the project. 
It will only be visible to people who can see the pages of your NarraFirma project. 
</p><p>
Next, <b>choose a story form</b> from the list of forms you already created.
This form will be permanently associated with the new story collection.
</p><p>
Finally, <b>CLICK THE CLOSE BUTTON</b>. Don't forget to do this. When you click the Close button,
NarraFirma creates a <strong>snapshot</strong> copy of the selected story form &mdash; as it stands at that moment &mdash;
and saves it in the story collection.
</p><p>
If you forget to click the Close button, you will create a story collection with no associated story form, 
and you will see errors when you try to add stories to the collection. 
If that happens, don't worry; you can fix it. Come back to this page, select the story collection in the list, then click <b>Edit</b>. 
Check that the correct story form is selected, then click the <b>Update Story Form</b> button.
</p>
<p>There are three ways to add stories to a story collection.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can <b>collect stories over the internet</b>. To do this, 
select your new story collection in the list, then click <b>Activate or Deactivate Web Form</b>.
Now look below the table and find the place where it says <b>The web address (URL) of this story collection is</b>.
Click on the link shown there, or copy and paste it into your browser. You can send that link to anyone, and
they will be able to use it to fill out your story form and add stories to the story collection.
</li><li>
You can <b>enter stories using the NarraFirma data-entry interface</b>. Go to the
<a href="help_page_enterStories.html">Enter or import stories</a> page and follow the instructions there.
</li><li>
You can <b>import stories you collected using a different surveying package</b>. 
Go to the
<a href="help_page_enterStories.html">Enter or import stories</a> page and follow the instructions there.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
When you associate a story form with a story collection, 
a <strong>snapshot</strong> of the story form, <em>as it appears at that moment</em>, 
is <strong>copied</strong> into the story collection. Any changes you make to the form 
or the questions <em>after</em> that moment will <em>not</em> be automatically reflected in the story collection. 
This is because once you start collecting (or entering) stories, you need all of your data 
to match up (or you won't see patterns in it).
</p>
<img src="help_importGuide_dataStorage.png" width="800">
<p>
You can <em>update</em> your story collection to use a revised story form - but do this with caution. 
To revise a story collection's associated story form:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the change (to the question or form) on the page on which you created it.</li>
<li>Return to this page.</li>
<li>Select the story collection you want to change.</li>
<li>Click <b>Edit</b>.</li>
<li>Click the <b>Update Story Form</b> button. Now your story collection will use the changed story form.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="question">
Can you give me a clearer picture of exactly what I can and cannot change in my story form
after I have started to collect stories?

	<tr>
		<th>For</th>
		<th>It's okay to change</th>
		<th>It's NOT okay to change</th>
		<th>But if you have to, you can...</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>A story form</td>
		<td>You can change any texts that appear on your story form that are not saved in your stories.
			For example, you can change the story form's title, introduction, and conclusion, 
			as well as any messages to participants (like "Thank you for sharing your story").</td>
		<td>Do not change the short name of the story form.</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Any kind of question</td>
		<td>You can change a question's text (what participants read) and write-in label.</td>
		<td>Do not change a question's short name. If you do, you will create new a question that 
			cannot be easily merged with the old question. 
			Also, do not change a question's type.</td>
		<td>If you need to change a question's short name, finish collecting your stories, then export your data,
			change the short name in both CSV files, and re-import it. See the <a href="help_page_importGuide.html">Import guide</a>
			for details. If you need to change a question's type .... some changes are simple, and others are probably impossible.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>A checkbox question</td>
		<td>You can change the text displayed after the checkbox, since this is a display-only option. 
			The value saved is a true/false value, no matter what it says on the checkbox.</td>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>A radiobuttons, select, or checkboxes question</td>
		<td>You can change the number of rows shown in a select question, because it is a display-only option.</td>
		<td>Do not change any of the available answers in the list.</td>
		<td>If you have to change one of the answers in your list
			(perhaps it is misspelled, for example), go ahead and make the change, then update the form.
			Later, when you look at your data, you will see two sets of counts: one count for the old answer, and one count for the new answer.
			You can merge these two answer counts together using display lumping during catalysis. See the help for the
			<a href="../catalysis/help_page_configureCatalysisReport.html">Configure catalysis report</a> page for details.
			You can also merge two answers by exporting, then importing your data.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>A slider question</td>
		<td>You can change the left and right slider labels after you start collecting stories. The values saved with the stories are numerical only.
			You can also change the label of the "Does not apply" checkbox under the slider. This is a display-only option.
		</td>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>One way to check what is safe to change in your story form is to look at the actual story data.
	Find (or create) a story that has a value for every question. Then go to the
	<a href="help_page_reviewIncomingStories.html">Review incoming stories</a> page.
	Select the story, click <b>Edit</b>, then scroll down and click the 
	<b>Show story as raw JSON data</b> button. In the window that appears, look at the story's data structure 
	and think about what will happen to it (and to other stories like it) if you make the changes
	you want to make to your questions or story form. (Ignore the prefixes before the question short names;
	those are used internally.)
</p>

<h3 class="question">
I have two story collections that are identical except for a few small differences. Can I merge them?
</h3>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
If the story forms used in the two story collections only differ in appearances &mdash; that is, the <i>data</i> is the same &mdash;
you can simply add both story collections to a catalysis report. NarraFirma will merge any questions and answers whose
short names are identical. (If the answers aren't identical, you can use display lumping to merge them.)
</p>
<p>
If the <i>data</i> in the two story collections are not the same (for example, their question short names differ), 
you can still merge your data, 
but you'll have to use CSV export and import to do it.
Export both story collections and their associated story forms
to the CSV file format. Then carefully merge the two CSV files into one file, using a spreadsheet. 
Then import the merged CSV file into a new story collection (along with the revised story form).
</p>
<p>If you are not sure what to do, one quick way to check is to 
	export both story collections to CSV files, then compare the files using a spreadsheet.</p>
