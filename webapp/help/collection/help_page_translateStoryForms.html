<div class="text">
	<p>In your story form, you can provide participants with a <b>choice of languages</b>.
		For example, a three-language story form might start like this.</p>

<p><img src="help_translate_question.png" width="600" border="1px solid black"></p>

<p>When a participant chooses a language from the list, the form will redraw itself in that language. 
	When the participant submits the form, NarraFirma will save the participant's language choice as a question you can graph.
</p>
<p>
	NarraFirma supports multi-lingual story forms using an optional <b>translation dictionary</b>. 
	For each piece of text that is to be displayed on the story form (or in the questions it references),
	a translation dictionary stores <b>alternative texts</b> to be displayed in other languages.
	This page of NarraFirma is where you can create and edit a story form's translation dictionary.

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<ol>
	<li>Choose the story form you want to translate.</li>
	<li>Enter a default language in which the form will appear when participants have not chosen a language.</li>
	<li>Enter a question participants will answer as they choose a language.
		(Tip: It's a good idea to write your choose-a-language question in every language you intend to support, as in the example above.)
	</li>
	<li>Enter a list of additional languages you want to support (one per line).</li>
	<li>Choose "Create or update translation dictionary" and click "Do it." A lot of empty text boxes will appear, one for each field-language combination.</li>
	<li>Fill in the translations for each text. 
		Do not translate the explanations that are shown after each text (in a smaller, italic font). They are meant to help you understand the context in which each text is used.</li>
	<li>Alternatively, you can export your translation dictionary to a CSV file, enter your translations there, and import the file.
		(Do not edit the default-language texts. Save the file as CSV with UTF-8 character encoding.)
	</li>
	<li>Periodically test your story form by choosing "Preview story form" and clicking "Do it." Run through each language choice, making sure the form reads correctly.</li>
</ol>

<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
What will happen if I change a text in the story form, or in the questions it uses, after I write the translation dictionary?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
The translation facility in NarraFirma is a simple one. It links translated texts to default-language texts. 
It has no idea where those texts belong in the form.
</p><p>
If you enter translations for a text, and then change the text in your story form, your translations of that text
will become "orphaned," or detached from the form. They will still be stored in the form, but they will 
never be displayed on it, because the default text to which they are linked has been removed.
</p>
<p>When this happens, there is an easy fix. Choose "Show orphaned translations," then click "Do it." 
	Copy the texts shown there and paste them into the text boxes for the field's new default text.
	The orphaned translations will stay in the form until you remove them. (Choose "Remove orphaned translations," then click "Do it.")
</p>
<p>To minimize the need to fix orphaned translations, we recommend that you design and test your story form
	in its default language <i>before</i> you enter your translations. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Can you explain the CSV import process in more detail?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<ol>
	<li>Fill in the three fields at the top of the "Translate story forms" page. Make sure to enter a default language, a language question, and at least one additional language.</li>
	<li>Synchronize the translation dictionary with your story form by choosing "Create or update translation dictionary" and clicking "Do it."</li>
	<li>Choose "Export translation dictionary." Choose a file location.</li>
	<li>Send the CSV file to your translator. Ask them to edit <i>only</i> the columns labeled with the alternative languages.
		They should not edit the default-language texts. Also ask them to make sure the file stays in CSV format with UTF-8 character encoding.
		(The CSV delimiter used will be the one you set on the "Project options" page, under "Project administration.")</li>
	<li>When you get the translated file back, go to the "Translate story forms" page. 
		Select the story form, choose "Import translations from CSV," then click "Do it."
		The new translations should appear in the form fields on the page. You can review them, and you can preview the story form.
	</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="question">
If I imported my story form from a CSV file, should my translation dictionary be part of that file?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
	Translation dictionaries are only used to display story forms in NarraFirma-administered surveys.
	If you collected your story data outside of NarraFirma, you will have no need for a translation dictionary.
	However, if you have language information from your surveying system,
	you can include that information in your imported CSV file. See the 
	<a href="help_page_importGuide.html">import guide</a> for details. 
</p>
<p>If you want to export a story form from one NarraFirma project and import it into another one, 
	you will need to export and import the translation dictionary separately from the form itself.
