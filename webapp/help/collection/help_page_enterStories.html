<p>
You can use this NarraFirma page to enter stories using a form that looks exactly like the web form your participants use in a web-based story collection. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
Choose a story collection, then click Add Story. In the window that appears, fill in the form just as if you were telling the story yourself. When you're done, click Submit Survey. If you want to check that your stories are being entered correctly, go to the <a href="help_page_reviewIncomingStories.html">Review incoming stories</a> page and look for them.

<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
Can I combine web-based and off-line story collection?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Yes. Enable the web collection (on the <a href="help_page_startStoryCollection.html">Start story collection</a> page), and add more stories on this page. Both types of stories will intermingle in your story collection.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
If I combine a web-based and off-line story collection, how can I tell which story came from where?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
You can add a question to your form that asks where the story came from. Participants can enter "web" and you can enter "off-line." Or you can add an extra question that distinguishes between the types of story by exporting and re-importing the stories after your story collection is finished.
