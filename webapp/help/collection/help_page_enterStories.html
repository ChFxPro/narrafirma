<div class="page-title">Enter stories</div>
<div class="text">
<p>
You can use this NarraFirma page to enter stories using a form that looks exactly like the web form your participants use in a web-based story collection. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
Choose a story collection, then click Add Story. In the window that appears, fill in the form just as 
if you were telling the story yourself. When you're done, click Submit Survey. If you want to 
check that your stories are being entered correctly, go to 
the <a href="help_page_reviewIncomingStories.html">Review incoming stories</a> page and look for them.
</p>
<p>
You can use this page to import story data from a CSV (comma-separated values) file
(which usually comes from a spreadsheet). (See below for formatting instructions.)
</p>
<p>
You can export your story form (the one associated with the story collection you choose at
the top of this page) and your entire story collection in CSV format (to look at it in a spreadsheet, for example).
</p>

<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
How do I delete a story I entered wrongly?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
NarraFirma does not let you delete stories completely. 
This is to avoid accidentally deleting important information. However, you can
mark a story to be <em>ignored</em>, which means it won't show up
in any counts or graphs or reports. It won't be visible
anywhere but the <a href="help_page_reviewIncomingStories.html">Review incoming stories</a> screen. 
</p>
<p>
To mark a story to be ignored:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a href="help_page_reviewIncomingStories.html">Review incoming stories</a> screen.</li>
<li>Select (click on) the story you want to ignore.</li>
<li>Under the list of stories, click "Edit."</li>
<li>Type something (anything) in the "Reason to ignore this story" box. For example, you might type "test story" or
"data entry error" or "response too incomplete to use."</li>
</ol>
<p>
A story with <em>any text</em> in the "Reason to ignore" field will be left out of all graphs and reports. 
(You can sort by the "Ignore" field on the <a href="help_page_reviewIncomingStories.html">Review incoming stories</a> screen 
to see the stories you have chosen to ignore and why.)
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
But what if I really need to delete a story? What if ignoring it isn't enough?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
You can permanently delete a story by exporting your story collection to CSV, removing the offending story row
 in a spreadsheet program, and importing the CSV file as a new story collection. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Can I combine web-based and off-line story collection?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Yes. Enable the web collection (on the <a href="help_page_startStoryCollection.html">Start story collection</a> page), and add more stories on this page. Both types of stories will intermingle in your story collection.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
If I combine a web-based and off-line story collection, how can I tell which story came from where?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
You can add a question to your form that asks where the story came from. 
Participants can enter "web" and you can enter "off-line." 
Or you can add an annotation that distinguishes between the types of story (see <a href="help_page_writeAnnotations.html">Write annotations about stories</a>).
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What is the correct format for importing data?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>You can import story data to match a story form created in NarraFirma or imported from CSV. To learn about the correct format for importing a 
	story form, see the help page for <a href="help_page_designStoryForms.html">Designing story forms</a>.
</p>
			<p>
				Now to your data file. The order of columns in your data file does not matter. What does matter is the <b>column headers</b>. 
				These names sit at the top of each column and tell NarraFirma what to read from that column. 
				They must EXACTLY match the "Short name" fields you specified, either in NarraFirma or in the story form file.	
			</p>
			<p>
				Three of the column headers are special. They must have the EXACT headers <b>Story title</b>, <b>Story text</b>, and <b>Eliciting question</b>. 
				You must specify the "Answers" for the Eliciting question in your story form file, and those must match up. You don't need to include
				anything about the "Story title" or "Story text" fields in your story form file. Those fields are asssumed (and required).
			</p>
			<p>
				After the data file's first row of headers, each additional row should describe one story. Each cell of each row should have in it either
				the story's title, the story's text, the question the story was told in response to, or the answer to a question about a story or its teller.
				If people told multiple stories, the answers to questions about participants must be repeated on each row that describes a story they told.
			</p>
			<p>
			
			</p>
			<p>How your data should appear in the data file depends on what type of question you are describing.</p>
			<ul>
					<li><b>Single choice</b> or <b>Radiobuttons</b>: One column. Enter one answer that EXACTLY matches one of the answers listed in NarraFirma or in the story form file. 
						If the question was not answered, leave the cell blank. 
					</li>					
					<li><b>Multiple choice</b>. As many columns as there are available answers.
						For each column (all with the same header, which is the question's short name), 
						enter one answer that EXACTLY matches one of the answers listed in NarraFirma or in the story form file. These must be lined up by column. So for example if
						one available answer is "trust," all the "trust" answers should be in the same column. But all the cells in that column 
						(except the header) should say "trust" or be empty. Do not indicate that a choice was selected by placing "1" or "yes" or anything else in the column.
						If the person did not answer the question, leave ALL of the columns for that question blank.</li>
					<li><b>Boolean</b>: One column. Enter only "yes" or "no." If the person did not answer the question, leave the cell blank.</li>
					<li><b>Checkbox</b>: One column. Enter one answer that EXACTLY matches the (sole) answer listed in NarraFirma or in the story form file. 
					Note that for a checkbox there is no way to distinguish between a non-answer and an unchecked answer.
					</li>
					<li><b>Scale</b>: One column. Normally this must be a number in the inclusive range from zero (0) to one hundred (100). 
						If you used a different range (say from zero to ten), you can specify that in your <a href="help_page_designStoryForms.html">story form</a> file. If the person did not answer the question,
						leave the cell blank.</li>
					<li><b>Text</b> or <b>Textarea</b>: One column. Enter the text as it was written or spoken.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
					<b>Other notes on data files</b>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>If you have multiple stories per participant</b>. If participants in your story collection were able to choose how many stories they told, 
						you might want to look at patterns
						of difference between people who told more or fewer stories. 
						To group your imported stories by participant,
						include a header in your data file called EXACTLY "Participant ID." Give each participant a UNIQUE ID 
						and enter it in that column on EACH line that describes a story they told. NarraFirma will sort your
						stories based on participant ID and count how many stories each person told.
					</li>
					<li><b>Watch your formatting</b>. Remember that a CSV file is not the same thing as a spreadsheet file. You can work in a spreadsheet format (like XLSX) but be aware that any
						special formatting will be lost when you convert the file to CSV. It's usually better to edit the file directly in the CSV format
						so you don't put anything into it that will be lost when you convert to CSV.
					</li>
					<li><b>UTF-8</b>. NarraFirma expects to read CSV data with UTF-8 character encoding. 
							Make sure to save your CSV files in that format so any special characters will be read correctly.</li>
					<li><b>Samples and templates</b>. An example data CSV file can be found in the <b>samples</b> folder in your NarraFirma installation.
						You can look at that file to see how data should be formatted. Also, if you have already created a story form (either in NarraFirma or by importing it from CSV), you can get a 
						blank data file to fill in (or just to see how the headers should look). Navigate to the Enter stories
						screen, choose the new story collection you created (with your story form attached to it), and click
						"Export story collection." You will get a blank CSV file with the correct headers to read back in as your data file.</li>
				</ul>
	
				<b>Weird things that could happen while importing data</b>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>You get empty graphs.</b> Check for mismatches between Short names in NarraFirma or your story form file and headers in your data file. 
					Case matters, so check for upper-case and lower-case mismatches as well. If you imported your story form, check it for missing short names.
					It's easy to fill in the Long name and forget to fill in the Short name.</li>
					<li><b>A graph count is wrong.</b> The contents of your data file cells 
						must EXACTLY match the answers you give for each question. For example, if you say that one of the answers for a question should be "both of them,"
						and your data file has a cell that says "both," that answer will not be counted. The cells must match up exactly.
					</li>
					<li><b>You see more stories than you should see.</b> To preserve data, NarraFirma doesn't delete stories when you delete a story collection;
					it just "unmoors" them. If you create another story collection <i>with the same name</i>, it reconnects any "lost" stories with the new collection.
					So if you are creating and deleting story collections (perhaps while trying to get your CSV files right), make sure you <i>use
					a new name for each collection</i>. That way you won't get extra stories in the way. (This also means you can get
					a story collection back if you deleted it by accident: just create another one with the same name.)</li>
				<li><b>Special characters get garbled.</b> Check the character encoding on your data file. It should be UTF-8.</li>
				</ul>
