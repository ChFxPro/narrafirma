<p>
You can use this NarraFirma page to enter stories using a form that looks exactly like the web form your participants use in a web-based story collection. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
Choose a story collection, then click Add Story. In the window that appears, fill in the form just as 
if you were telling the story yourself. When you're done, click Submit Survey. If you want to 
check that your stories are being entered correctly, go to 
the <a href="help_page_reviewIncomingStories.html">Review incoming stories</a> page and look for them.
</p>
<p>
You can use this page to import story data from a CSV (comma-separated values) file
(which usually comes from a spreadsheet). (See below for formatting instructions.)
</p>
<p>
You can export your story form (the one associated with the story collection you choose at
the top of this page) and your entire story collection in CSV format (to look at it in a spreadsheet, for example).

<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
Can I combine web-based and off-line story collection?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Yes. Enable the web collection (on the <a href="help_page_startStoryCollection.html">Start story collection</a> page), and add more stories on this page. Both types of stories will intermingle in your story collection.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
If I combine a web-based and off-line story collection, how can I tell which story came from where?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
You can add a question to your form that asks where the story came from. 
Participants can enter "web" and you can enter "off-line." 
Or you can add an annotation that distinguishes between the types of story (see <a href="help_page_writeAnnotations.html">Write annotations about stories</a>).
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What is the correct format for importing data?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
The first two columns of your data file must be the story title (with the header "Story title")
and story text (with the header "Story text"). The rest of the columns must match the short names
of your questions about stories and questions about participants, in the order they are given
in the story form. If you entered your questions (and story form) into NarraFirma, export
the form to CSV (on the <a href="help_page_designStoryForms.html">Design story forms</a> page), then make sure your columns
of data match the specifications there.
</p>
<p>
If you have not entered your questions into NarraFirma,
we suggest that you look at the sample data set that comes with NarraFirma to see how you should
format your data to be read in correctly.
