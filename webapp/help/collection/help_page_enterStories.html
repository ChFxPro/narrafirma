<div class="text">
<p>
You can use this NarraFirma page to enter stories using a form that looks exactly like the web form your participants use in a web-based story collection. 
You can also import stories from a CSV file.
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
Choose a story collection, then click Add Story. In the window that appears, fill in the form just as 
if you were telling the story yourself. When you're done, click Submit Survey. If you want to 
check that your stories are being entered correctly, go to 
the <a href="help_page_reviewIncomingStories.html">Review incoming stories</a> page and look for them.
</p>
<p>
You can use this page to import story data from a CSV (comma-separated values) file
(which usually comes from a spreadsheet). (See below for formatting instructions.)
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
What is the correct format for importing data?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>You can read all about importing data in our <a href="help_page_importGuide.html">Guide to importing data</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
How do I delete a story I entered wrongly?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
NarraFirma does not let you delete stories completely. 
This is to avoid accidentally deleting important information. However, you can
mark a story to be <em>ignored</em>, which means it won't show up
in any counts or graphs or reports. It won't be visible
anywhere but the <a href="help_page_reviewIncomingStories.html">Review incoming stories</a> screen. 
</p>
<p>
To mark a story to be ignored:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a href="help_page_reviewIncomingStories.html">Review incoming stories</a> screen.</li>
<li>Select (click on) the story you want to ignore.</li>
<li>Under the list of stories, click "Edit."</li>
<li>Type something (anything) in the "Reason to ignore this story" box. For example, you might type "test story" or
"data entry error" or "response too incomplete to use."</li>
</ol>
<p>
A story with <em>any text</em> in the "Reason to ignore" field will be left out of all graphs and reports. 
(You can sort by the "Ignore" field on the <a href="help_page_reviewIncomingStories.html">Review incoming stories</a> screen 
to see the stories you have chosen to ignore and why.)
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
But what if I really need to delete a story? What if ignoring it isn't enough?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
You can permanently delete a story by exporting your story collection to CSV, removing the offending story row
 in a spreadsheet program, and importing the CSV file as a new story collection. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Can I combine web-based and off-line story collection?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Yes. Enable the web collection (on the <a href="help_page_startStoryCollection.html">Start story collection</a> page), and add more stories on this page. Both types of stories will intermingle in your story collection.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
If I combine a web-based and off-line story collection, how can I tell which story came from where?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
You can add a question to your form that asks where the story came from. 
Participants can enter "web" and you can enter "off-line." 
Or you can add an annotation that distinguishes between the types of story (see <a href="help_page_writeAnnotations.html">Write annotations about stories</a>).
