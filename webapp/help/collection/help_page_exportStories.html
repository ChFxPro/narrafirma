<div class="question">
		What's the difference between the two "Export story form" buttons?
	</div>
	<div class="question-answer">
	<p>
	<b>Export story form with options for external import</b>.
	If you imported your story data to NarraFirma from a different survey system, 
	you specified import options that helped NarraFirma read the foreign data file. 
	NarraFirma has preserved this information in its fields, which you can see in the NarraFirma interface.
	This button saves your story form with those original import options intact.
	You can use that file to import the same foreign data file into another NarraFirma project. 
	</p>
	<p><b>Export story form with options for NarraFirma-native import</b>.
		When you export stories from NarraFirma, it writes the stories in its own preferred format.
		(Specifically, it prefers the "Single choice" and "Multi-choice multi-column texts" options, and it uses scale ranges of 0-100.)
		This button saves your story form with NarraFirma's preferred import options.
		You can use that file to import a CSV story file you exported from NarraFirma.

<div class="question">
	When I try to read my stories (or story form) in Excel, it doesn't look right.
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Excel doesn't convert CSV files to its format very well when you open them directly. To open a CSV file correctly in Excel, 
create an empty spreadsheet, then choose Data - Get External Data - Import Text File. When asked
what delimiter to use (to distinguish one column from the next), choose "comma." You may need to
try a few different options for the "Text qualifier" and "Text encoding."
