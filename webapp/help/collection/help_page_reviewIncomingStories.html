<p>
On this page you can look over the stories being collected over the web (or entered by you). 
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
If you want to look at all of the collected stories, ignore the "Filter by" choices above the list of stories, and just click on a story, then click "View" (or double-click a story). Below the list of stories you will see the information for the story you chose.
</p>
<p>
If you want to look at specific subsets of stories, choose a question on one or both of the "Filter by" choice boxes, then choose which answers you want to see. For example, you might choose "Age," then "25-50," and you would see only stories told by people between 25 and 50. If you select two questions, you will see only stories that match both criteria, such as for example, people between 25 and 50 who told stories about which they said they felt "satisfied."
