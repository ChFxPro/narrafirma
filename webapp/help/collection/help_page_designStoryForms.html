<p>
In NarraFirma, <strong>story forms</strong> are questionnaires people use to tell stories and to answer questions about their stories.</p>
<p>
A story form combines three types of question:</p>
<ol>
<li>eliciting questions (in answer to which people tell stories on the form)</li>
<li>questions about stories (which ask people to reflect on the story they just told)</li>
<li>questions about participants (direct questions unrelated to any story)</li>
</ol>
<p>
These three types of questions come together, in that order, on the story form.
</p>
<p>
If your story collection is on-line, your participants will use the story forms you create. If you collect your stories off-line, <em>you</em> will use the story form to enter your stories into NarraFirma.
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
To create a story form, click the Add button. Give the form a short unique name (so you can find it again). 
Give it a title; this will appear in a large font at the start of the form. Provide an introduction 
(something like "Please tell us about your experiences."). Choose from the questions you already 
created (in the previous pages). Finally, choose some closing text (something like "Thanks for your help") 
to be shown at the end of the form. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
What happens if I change a question after I've added it to a story form?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Any changes you make to questions after you add them to a story form will be reflected in the form. 
A story form is a <em>grouping</em> of questions, not a <em>copy</em> of them. You can think of questions as a <strong>library</strong> from which you draw selections.
</p>
<p>Why are the questions separated from the form? Because: </p>
<ul>
<li>you can reuse the same questions on multiple story forms (instead of having to rewrite them every time you want to create a new form)</li>
<li>you can try out different designs (of your questions and your form) before you commit to a story collection</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="question">
What happens if I change a question after I've added it to a story form and used that story form in a story collection?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
When you choose a story form for a story <a href="help_page_startStoryCollection.html">collection</a>, 
a <strong>snapshot</strong> of the story form, <em>as it appears at that moment</em>, 
is <strong>copied</strong> into the story collection. Any changes you make to the form 
or the questions <em>after</em> that moment will <em>not</em> be automatically reflected in the story collection. 
This is because once you start collecting (or entering) stories, you need all of your data 
to match up (or you won't see patterns in it).
</p>
<p>
You can <em>update</em> your story collection to use a revised story form 
(in the <a href="help_page_startStoryCollection.html">Start story collection</a> page). 
But you should do this with caution. Use it to fix typographical errors, not changes that can alter 
the data already collected.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Do I have to use more than one eliciting question?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
No. If you create only one eliciting question, NarraFirma will show it (without choices) on the story form above the text box for the story.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What should I do with the "texts"?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
There are several places on a story form where you can specify messages to participants. All of these places have defaults (shown below in bold), so 
you don't <i>need</i> to customize them; but you can. Here are some ways to phrase these messages.
</p>
<p><b>Please choose a question to which you would like to respond.</b> Some other ideas are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Which of these questions would you like to answer?</li>
		<li>Choose a question that appeals to you.</li>
		<li>Which of these questions connects best to your experiences?</li>
		<li>Pick the question you like best.</li>
<li>But don't say:
<ul>
<li>Choose the question that best fits your story. (This implies that they already "have" a story, and only one story, to tell.)</li>
<li>You must choose one of these questions. (Doesn't invite; is not conversational.)</li>
	<li>Choose the best question for your experiences. (Asking people to rank questions may cause them to think 
				that you will be ranking their story. You can use the word "best," but use it to describe connection or fit, not quality.
				Never even hint that quality is what you are looking for.)</li>
				<li>Does any of these questions relate to your experiences? (Sometimes the answer will just be "no".)</li>
				</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<b>Please enter your response in the box below.</b> Some other ideas are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Please answer the question you chose here.</li>
			<li>You can type your answer here.</li>
			<li>Tell us what happened here. What do you remember?</li>
			<li>But don't say:
					<ul>
			<li>Answer the question to the best of your ability. (It sounds like an interrogation.)</li>
			<li>Explain what happened here. (You'll only get dry facts if you ask that way.)</li>
			<li>Give us your story here. (It makes their story into a thing, not a conversation.)
			</li>
		</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<b>Please give your story a name.</b> Some other ideas are:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>What name would you like to give this story?</li>
			<li>If you were to give this story a name, what would it be?</li>
			<li>How would you like to refer to this story?</li>
		<li>But don't say:
				<ul>
			<li>Give your story a title. (The word "title" is performative, and it makes people worry that their story will not be good enough.
				The word "name" puts less pressure on the teller.)</li>
			<li>If your story was in a newspaper, what headline would it have? (If these are personal stories, people will not want to visualize them being in a newspaper. Also, 
					asking people to write a headline makes the story seem like you want it to be exciting or sensational.)</li>
			<li>Give us a way to refer to your story. (It makes the story seem like a thing.)
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>


<p>
<b>Would you like to tell another story?</b> Some other ideas are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Is there any other experience you would like to tell us about?</li>
			<li>Would you like to tell us about something else that happened?</li>
			<li>Does this story remind you of another experience you'd like to tell us about?</li>
			<li>Is there another experience you can recall that you think would be helpful for our project?</li>
			<li>But don't say:
					<ul>
			<li>Do you have any other stories to tell? (It makes people feel that you are taking things from them, not talking to them.)</li>
			<li>Think of another story you can give us. (Same problem: it makes the story seem like a thing being taken from people.)</li>
			<li>Is there anything else you'd like to tell us? (There is no reference to stories or experiences here. People will expect to have a chance to type in opinions or something.
				 You can give them such a chance, but you should use a non-story-eliciting question to do it.)
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		</ul>

<p>
	<b>Yes, I'd like to tell another story.</b> This is the text on the button people push to tell another story. Some other ideas are:</p>
			<ul>
					<li>Yes</li>
					<li>I would like to tell another story</li>
					<li>I remember another time I could tell you about</li>
				<li>I would like to tell about another experience</li>
				<li>But don't say:
						<ul>
				<li>I have another story (Anything you can "have" is a thing. This should be a conversation.)</li>
				<li>I have more to say (They might not realize you want them to tell another <i>story</i>.)</li>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	

				
				

</div>


<div class="question">
		How do I use the "Custom CSS" feature?
		</div>
		<div class="question-answer">
		<p>
		Preview your story form and use your browser to <strong>inspect</strong> any element of the page you want to change. 
		(The usual way to do this is to right-click on a word or area and choose "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" from the popup menu that appears.
		If you don't see a popup menu or an "Inspect" menu item, look up how to inspect a web page element in the browser you are using.
		Sometimes you need to turn on "developer" mode to inspect page elements.)
		</p>
		<p>When you have successfully inspected the page element you want to change, you should see its CSS class. Most of the classes start with "narrafirma-".
		</p>
		<p>Next go to the "custom CSS" field for your story form and
		write a class selector (label) and declaration (set of formatting lines)
		for that class. 
		For example, if you wanted to change the introductory text of your story form to appear in blue, you would write a CSS statement
		like this:
		<code><br/><br/>
			.narrafirma-survey-start-text { <br/>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; color: blue;<br/>
		}<br/><br/>
		</code>
		<p>
			Then preview the form again to see your change. (Don't reload the preview page; you have to click the "Preview Story Form" button again.)
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Notes on custom CSS</b></p>
		<ul>
				<li>The CSS you enter affects the survey's appearance when you preview it and when a participant sees it (using the URL you give them). 
						It is <i>not</i> used when you enter a story on the "Enter or import stories" page (because that form is a popup dialog, not a separate web page).
						If you need to change how the story entry dialog appears, you will need to change the CSS files distributed with NarraFirma.
						</li>
						<li>If you don't know how to use CSS, look through one of the many excellent tutorials on the web.</li>
		<li>In addition to classes, some survey elements have numbered IDs. Be careful using these,
			because the numbers will change if you move the questions around. But you can set styles on particular elements 
			(using the ID selector with #)
			after you are sure your question order will not change.
		</li>
		<li>If you don't want people to see a particular element of the form (like say the number on sliders), you can use Custom CSS to
			set the display tag to "none" (display: none) for that class or ID, and it won't appear on the page.
		</li>
		</div>

<div class="question">
How do you import a story form? What is the correct format?
	</div>
	<div class="question-answer">
	<p>
	You can create a story form using NarraFirma, or you can create one in a spreadsheet, export it as a CSV (comma-separated values) file, and import it into NarraFirma. 
	You can then use the story form to collect stories using NarraFirma, or you can import stories you collected (using that form) outside of NarraFirma.
	</p>
	<p>
		The first readable (non-comment) line in your story form file MUST be a row of <b>headers</b>, among which are <b>Long name</b>, <b>Short name</b>, 
		<b>Type</b>, <b>About</b>, and <b>Answers</b>. The headers must read EXACTLY thus, but they need not be in that order. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Following the required header row, each remaining row in your story form file should tell NarraFirma about one 
		<b>question</b> in the form. Specifically, each row should describe that question's:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Long name</b>: The long-form question you would like to ask on the story form.</li>
		<li><b>Short name</b>: What name you would like to use to refer to the question in lists and on graphs. This short name is also the question's identifier.
			It <b>must be unique</b> in the project you are working with.</li>
		<li><b>Type</b>: What sort of question you would like to ask, and what sort of data to collect:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Single choice</b>: Texts in a drop-down list</li>
				<li><b>Multiple choice</b>: A series of labeled checkboxes (in CSV, one answer per column, with the answer text in each cell)</li>
				<li><b>Multiple choice yes/no</b>: A series of labeled checkboxes (in CSV, one answer per column, with the answer text in the header and a "yes indicator" (or not) in each cell)</li>
				<li><b>Multiple choice delimited</b>: A series of labeled checkboxes (in CSV, one column only, with answers delimited by a specified string)</li>
				<li><b>Radiobuttons</b>: A series of labeled buttons (of which only one can be clicked "on")</li>
				<li><b>Boolean</b>: Two radio buttons labeled "yes" and "no"</li>
				<li><b>Checkbox</b>: One labeled checkbox</li>
				<li><b>Scale</b>: A line with a slider button between two labeled ends</li>
				<li><b>Text</b>: A short (one line) text field</li>
				<li><b>Textarea</b>: A multi-line text field</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		<li><b>About</b>: To what the question pertains
			<ul>
					<li><b>eliciting</b>: The question presents a <i>menu of questions</i> people can choose to tell stories about</li>
					<li><b>story</b>: The question is about the story (and should be asked after the story is told)</li>
				<li><b>participant</b>: The question is about the storyteller (and should be asked in the "About you" section of the form, after all stories have been told)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		<li><b>Answers</b>: Options the participant can choose from to answer the question. What should be entered into these columns differs by question type.
			<ul>
				<li>For questions of the types <b>Single choice</b>, <b>Multiple choice</b>, <b>Radiobuttons</b>, 
					or <b>Checkbox</b>, enter one answer per column, moving from left to right. The order in which answers are written here will be the order they are shown on the
					story form and on graphs.</li>
				<li>For a <b>Multiple choice delimited</b> question, enter first the delimiter that will separate answers within the single column of data in your CSV file.
					Often this delimiter will be a comma, but it could be something else. 
					(Whatever you use as a delimiter, make sure there are none of those things in your answers!)
					After the delimiter, enter one answer per column, moving from left to right.</li>
				<lil>For a <b>Multiple choice yes/no</b> question, enter first the case-sensitive indicator of a yes answer, such as "Yes" or "1."" 
					Anything other than that exact text will be taken as a "no" for that answer.
					After the delimiter, enter one answer per column, moving from left to right.
					(Note that the column headers in the data file for this type of question
					<i>must</i> have the format "Q==A" where Q is the question name and A is the answer for that column.
					These header texts <i>must</i> match the question and answer names specified here, so you may have to edit your data file to match what you put here.)
				</lil>
				<li> For <b>Scale</b> questions, enter first the left-side label, then the right-side label. </li>
				<li> For <b>Boolean</b>, <b>Text</b>, and <b>Textarea</b> questions, leave the Answer columns blank.</li>
				<li>For the <b>Eliciting question</b>, enter the questions you want to ask people, one per Answer cell. Do not create one row per question
				you want to ask people! Enter only one row for the entire menu of questions. 
				In each of the Answer cells, enter the short name for that question, then a pipe character (which looks like this: |), then the long name.
				If you did not ask an eliciting question (or you have no data for it), you can leave this line out of the file.
				</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	<p><b>More things you can specify</b></p>
	<ul>
			<li>You can specify <b>messages to participants</b>, to be shown at the start and end of your story form. 
					To do this, create one row per specified message, each with the "About" cell reading "form"
					and "Type" cells reading one of:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Title</b>: to be shown at the top of the story form</li>
						<li><b>Start text</b>: introductory text to be shown after the title</li>
						<li><b>Image</b>: a valid web link (URL) to be shown at the top of the form</li>
						<li><b>About you text</b>: header for the questions about participants</li>
						<li><b>Thank you text</b>: what to say in the popup dialog after the form is submitted</li>
						<li><b>End text</b>: what to say on the page after the form is submitted</li>
						<li><b>Choose question text</b>: what to say other than "Please choose a question to which you would like to respond."</li>
						<li><b>Enter story text</b>: what to say other than "Please enter your response in the box below."</li>
						<li><b>Name story text</b>: what to say other than "Please give your story a name."</li>
						<li><b>Tell another story text</b>: what to say other than "Would you like to tell another story?"</li>
						<li><b>Tell another story button</b>: what the button should say other than "Yes, I'd like to tell another story."</li>
						<li><b>Max num stories</b>: how many stories people can tell (before the "tell another story" page element stops appearing)</li>
						<li><b>Custom CSS</b>: text that changes the formatting of elements on the page 
							(Note: make sure CSS text is fully contained within the spreadsheet cell and doesn't spill over to other cells.)</li>
						<li><b>Custom CSS for Printing</b>: text that changes the formatting of elements in the printed story form 
								(Note: make sure CSS text is fully contained within the spreadsheet cell and doesn't spill over to other cells.)</li>
						</ul>
						In the first "Answers" column, place the
					text to be shown in each of these areas. For "Image" the text will be a URL (web address) for the image to be displayed.
					(Note that it must be a FULL web address, starting with "http://www.")
					For the text fields, these HTML tags are allowed: b, big, em, i, s, small, sup, sub, strong, strike, u.			
				</li>
				<li>NarraFirma expects to read scale data with values ranging from zero to 100. If you collected data with some other scale, say
					from 1 to 10, you can <b>specify your scalar range</b> in your story form file. To do this, create a line with the "About" cell reading "import"
					and the "Type" cell reading "Scale range." In the "Answers" cells put first the lowest value of the range and second the highest value
					(e.g., 1, then 10). NarraFirma will convert your scale data to a 0-100 scale as it is being read in.
				</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<b>Other notes on the story form file</b>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The order in which you list the questions in your story form file will be the order in which questions are shown 
			on the story form and in lists. (Actually, this is true only <i>within</i> the subsets of questions about stories
			and questions about participants. Questions about participants are <i>always</i> shown after questions about stories.)</li>
		<li>You can include comment lines in your story form file. Place a semicolon (;) as the very first character on the line. Everything else on that line 
		will be ignored. Empty lines will also be ignored. </li>
		<li>You can also include extra or comment columns. Any columns with names other than <b>Long name</b>,
		<b>Short name</b>, <b>Type</b>, <b>About</b>, or <b>Answers</b> will be ignored. However, place your extra columns <i>to the left</i> of
		the <b>Answers</b> column. All texts in cells to the right of that column will be treated as answers. </li>
		<li>Remember that a CSV file is not the same thing as a spreadsheet file. You can work in a spreadsheet format (like XLSX) but be aware that any
			special formatting will be lost when you convert the file to CSV. It's usually better to edit the file directly in the CSV format
			so you don't put anything into it that will be lost when you convert to CSV.
		</li>
		<li>NarraFirma expects to read CSV data with <b>UTF-8 character encoding</b>. 
				Make sure to save your CSV files in that format so any special characters will be read correctly.</li>
		<li>An example story form file can be found in the <b>samples</b> folder in your NarraFirma installation.
			You can copy that file and amend it to match your story form.</li>
	</ul>

	<b>Weird things that could happen while importing story forms</b>
</p>
<ul>
		<li><b>You see more questions than you should see.</b> To preserve data, NarraFirma doesn't delete questions when you delete a story form;
			it just "unmoors" them. If you create another story form <i>with the same name</i>, it reconnects any "lost" questions with the new form.
			So if you are creating and deleting story forms (perhaps while trying to get your CSV files right), make sure you <i>use
			a new name for each form</i>. That way you won't get extra questions in the way. (This also means you can get
			a story form back if you deleted it by accident: just create another one with the same name.)</li>
		<li><b>Your new answers get discarded.</b> NarraFirma really doesn't want you to lose your data. So if you try to import a question that has the same name
			as an existing question but has different answers, it will keep your old question and throw away your new answers. To import a new question
			with the same name and new answers, go to the "Write questions about stories" or "Write questions about participants" screen and delete the question there. 
			Then import the story form again. This time your new options will appear.
		</li>
<li><b>Special characters get garbled.</b> Check the character encoding on your story form file. It should be UTF-8.</li>
	</ul>

<div class="question">
Do you have any advice for putting together story forms?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
<p>Here are some excerpts from <em><a href="http://www.workingwithstories.org">Working with Stories</a></em>
(from pages 153-157) that can help you design story forms.
</p>
<div class="book-quote">
<p>
<p>A set of questions about a story is half of a conversation you hope to have with people about the story. To make sure the question set grows into a full conversation (of the kind that leads to excellent catalyzing material for sensemaking), here are some guidelines you can follow in how you put questions together.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Create an interesting, varied experience
</div>
<p>I recommend creating a <i>mixture</i> of question types (free entry, named choices, scales) within any set of questions about stories. I recommend this for two reasons. First, mixtures keep the question-answering activity interesting by reducing monotony. Even though people may be able to read and understand questions more quickly if they are all the same type, people may get one question confused with another or get bored. There is a natural tension between people&rsquo;s need to understand (hence the need for clarity and consistency) and their tendency to get bored or lose interest when things repeat (hence the need for variety). You can create clarity without sacrificing variety.
</p>
<p>Secondly, varied questions produce more interesting patterns to catalyze sensemaking. If you asked every single question with a fixed choice list, for example, all of your catalytic images would be bar graphs of counts (this many people told about dogs, this many about cats, etc.). But if you asked some fixed-choice questions, some scalar questions, and some free-entry questions, you will end up with several types of images: scatterplots, bubble correlation diagrams, annotated lists, even 3D landscapes. The point of catalysis is to stimulate thought and discussion, and for this diversity of images is a boon. So build diversity into your questions, the better to work with the answers later.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Design a conversational flow
</div>
<p>Order your questions like a conversation. Make them flow naturally. If you were asking someone questions in person, which would you start with? Having to switch gears or answer questions in an order that doesn&rsquo;t seem natural wastes cognitive budget. It is more important that a question seem related to the ones around it <i>by what it asks about</i> than by what type it is. Try asking your questions out loud. Listen to whether the order jars or flows freely. Does it make sense to ask about this after that? Does the story of the conversation flow naturally?
</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve found, for example, is that the &ldquo;how do you feel&rdquo; question likes to be asked right after the story is told. Doing this sets the stage for the questions that come after it. It communicates to the participants that you will be asking them to think about their personal feelings about the story, not asking them for facts and figures. In general, the further away you get from the story, the less vivid the storyteller&rsquo;s emotions about it will be, so it is often best to ask the more factual questions later. Asking factual questions first can put people into classification mode and reduce their emotional response when you need it most.
</p>
<div class="book-quote-heading">
Create a question form that supports the flow of stories
</div>
<p>Your question form should <i>answer all expected questions</i> about the purpose of the session. For example, if you anticipate concerns about anonymity or the distribution of collected stories, address them on the form. 
</p>
<p>Your form should be <i>concise</i>. You cannot expect people to spend more than about thirty seconds reviewing the form, so you need to use that tiny budget wisely. Keep your statements to a few short sentences. For example, &ldquo;Today we are sharing experiences about our town&rsquo;s wildlife. Your input is anonymous. The stories we tell today will support future discussions.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>Your form should be abundantly <i>clear</i>. To test this, take a draft of your form and place it in front of anyone you can find&mdash;neighbors, relatives, children&mdash;and ask them to skim it, then explain what they think it says. If what they say it says is not what you meant it to say, make another draft. The last thing you need is to have your group story session snagged on ten minutes of people asking what you mean by &ldquo;new urbanism&rdquo; or some other bit of jargon out of place.
</p>
<p>Your form should <i>not</i> include a lecture about stories or storytelling. This is a common mistake of inexperienced story collectors. It does not matter if participants know what a story is. It only matters if they tell stories. Whether they tell stories is more likely to be damaged than improved by information that will only make them self-conscious.
</p>
<p>Your form should be <i>grammatically perfect</i>. I know that sounds pedantic, but believe me, there <i>will</i> be pedants in any group of participants, and you will irritate them. The non-pedants will not be irritated, but they will still be distracted. Trivial things like subjects and verbs that don&rsquo;t agree, such as &ldquo;How long ago does the events in this story take place&rdquo; can stop people up. <i>Never disrupt the flow of stories</i>.
</p>
<p>The more smoothly your questions flow, the better the results you will see. Keep people focused on their own reflective processes, not on your presentation and its flaws. And be careful: once you&rsquo;ve been working on a question set for a while, it all begins to seem perfectly logical even if it isn&rsquo;t. Try your questions out on somebody you can watch, and see where they pause and ponder. Where does their pencil hover? Is it because they are thinking about the story, or because they are trying to figure out what you meant by your poorly presented question? Increase the former and reduce the latter.
</p>
<p>Your form should be <i>attractive,</i> even appealing. People respond to beautiful design. Handing your participants something printed badly in an unreadable m&eacute;lange of fonts sends a message that you don&rsquo;t value their contribution, because you didn&rsquo;t bother preparing something nice for them to work with. It&rsquo;s like inviting someone to visit your home, then asking them to sit on a dirty floor. Give people something beautiful that will feel like an honor to use. This may sound silly, but I&rsquo;ve seen it make a difference. When you want to get people telling stories, use every opportunity at your disposal to send a message of appreciation and respect. Pick up a book on &ldquo;design for dummies&rdquo; and take its advice.

<p>Lastly, your form should be a thought <i>landscape,</i> not a thought jail. Drop a casual hint at the start of the session that people can use their forms to take notes or make comments on the questions or the session or anything they like. Mention that if they don&rsquo;t like a question they can write that, or if they can&rsquo;t decide between two answers they can circle both (and say <i>why</i> they circled both, if they like). If they have a random thought about the project, they can feel free to jot down some notes on it. Leave room on the pages for all of this, or even mark out a section that says &ldquo;your notes.&rdquo; If you can have a small photocopier in the room so people can keep a copy of their pages if they like, that will help make the point as well. 
</p>
<p>This mindset may be alien to both you and your participants, and the physical form of a sheet of questions may constrain your thought about the interaction. Allowing changes to the expected form will help shift expectations toward participation. You want people to see the form as an opportunity to reflect, not a trial to endure. You want them to create, not simply dump out, their interpretations, because in that way they will participate in sensemaking as they reflect.
</p>
<p>Why go to all this trouble? Why shift expectations toward participation? Because it will improve the catalytic material that results, which will improve the sensemaking that comes later. It will also have an impact on the return of stories to your community or organization.
