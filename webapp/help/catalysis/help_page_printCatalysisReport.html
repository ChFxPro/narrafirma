<p>
This page is simple: you use it to print a copy of the catalysis report you created
in the previous pages.
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
Choose a catalysis report to print, then click "Print selected catalysis report." A new
page will appear with the report on it. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
Can I format my catalysis report?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Yes. You can specify many aspects of your catalysis report, from writing a custom introduction and conclusion to 
controlling the look of the report with custom CSS classes.
All of this is controlled from the "Configure Catalysis Report" page.
See the <a href="help_page_configureCatalysisReport.html">help</a> for that page for tips.

<div class="question">
		My word processor can't read the images in the HTML file. What can I do?
		</div>
		<div class="question-answer">
		<p>
		Some word processors have trouble reading the PNG files NarraFirma
		generates in the catalysis report. Try a different word processor. If that
		doesn't work, you can save each graph (right-click and choose Save Image As, or something
		like that, depending on your browser), then import the images into your
		word processor that way. You might also be able to copy an image to the clipboard
		and paste it into your word processor.
		</p>
		<p>
		Another possibility is to print the web page to a PDF file, then 
		open the PDF file in something that can save the file to other formats
		(like Acrobat Pro). Depending on your operating system, available software,
		and what you want to do with the report,
		different things are going to work for you.

<div class="question">
Why would I want to report only observations?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
So you can facilitate and record a <b>group catalysis session</b>, where a group of people writes and clusters 
interpretations for your catalysis report. Here's how to do it.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Look at the patterns in your data on the "Explore Patterns" page. Write an observation for each pattern that stands out.
		Do this as objectively as possible; for example, you might write an observation for each statistically significant difference.
	</li>
	<li>Print a catalysis report with only the observations you wrote. Also print story cards.</li>
	<li><b>Invite some people to work with you.</b> You'll need at least two or three people.</li>
	<li>A good rule of thumb is to plan to spend <b>ten minutes per observation</b>. 
		If you have a lot of observations, invite more people, or choose a subset
		of your observations to put before the group (maybe only the ones you've marked as strongest).
	</li>
	<li>At your workshop, show the people your observations, one at a time. Ask them to talk about each observation and look at some of the stories involved.
		If you have enough participants to break into groups of three, you can split up the observations and get through them faster.
	</li>
	<li>Ask people to collaborate on writing <b>at least two competing interpretations of each observation</b>.
		For each interpretation, ask them to write <i>a clear explanation of what the observation means from a particular perspective</i>.
	</li><li>
		Be sure to explain that <b>the interpretations must disagree</b> with each other. 
		Remember to explain <i>why</i> this is useful.
	</li>
	<li>Ask the people to give each interpretation they come up with a <b>short name</b> (on a sticky note) and a <b>description</b> (on a sheet of paper). 
		They can write both things down, or they can only write down the name and <i>say</i> the description into an audio recording
		(which you will later transcribe).
	</li>
	<li>At the end of the workshop, ask the people to <b>cluster the interpretation names</b> they wrote. Ask them to give the clusters names.</li>
	<li>Take good photographs of the session, making sure that you can read all of the clustered sticky notes.</li>
	<li>After the session, go back to NarraFirma. For each observation, enter the interpretations people gave for it. If you made an audio recording, 
		transcribe what they said about each interpretation.</li>
	<li>After you have entered all of the interpretations, arrange them into the clusters people put them in, and use the cluster names for the perspectives.</li>
	<li>Now you're ready to print your catalysis report and use it in a sensemaking session.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some tips on group narrative catalysis:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Why</b> facilitate a group catalysis session? To spread the work around; to reduce costs; to involve your participants more fully;
		to get better "buy-in" from people who might feel their words were being twisted or misrepresented otherwise; to improve the utility of your catalysis report;
		to draw on more imaginations than just your own; to make up for gaps in your own understanding.
	</li><li>
			<b>Why not</b> facilitate a group catalysis session? You can't get enough people to help;
	those who are willing to help can't understand the graphs they'd need to work with;
	the people doing the sensemaking trust you more than other people; 
	you are better at catalysis than
	the people who are willing to help; somebody asked you to do catalysis;
	nobody else has the time. 
	</li>
	<li>In your workshop, don't ask different groups of people to come up with competing interpretations for the same observations. It won't work. People will just argue. 
		The <i>same</i> people must come up with interpretations on <i>multiple sides</i> of the observations. 
	</li>
	<li>If people don't like the idea of disagreeing with themselves, explain that they are doing a sort of "devil's advocate" brainstorming exercise.
		It also helps to explain how the interpretations they are writing will be useful in the sensemaking exercise(s) yet to come.
	</li>
	<li>Don't do this via email. People have to be able to talk with each other in real time.</li>
	<li>Some people have an easier time making sense of graphs and charts than others. You can help with this by giving people a five or ten minute introduction
		on what each graph type means and how to read it. You can also ask people to team up in such a way that each group has at least one person
		who is familiar with graphs (and maybe statistics). </li>
	<li>How many people is <i>too</i> many for such a session? Divide the number of people you expect by three (because three is the best small group size).
		Then divide the number of observations you have by how many groups you will have. That's how many observations each group will need to go through.
		If that number is in the 5-10 range, you've got the right number of people. 
		If each group will have fewer than five observations to look at, the session will be unsatisfying.
		If each group will have more than ten observations to look at, they will get overwhelmed or bored.
