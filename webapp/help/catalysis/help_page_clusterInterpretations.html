<div class="page-title">Cluster interpretations and/or observations</div>
<div class="text">
<p>
On the
<a href="help_page_explorePatterns.html">previous page</a>,
you made <strong>observations</strong> about patterns in your data.
For each observation, you entered multiple
<strong>interpretations</strong> about what that observation might mean
(to reasonable people who happen to disagree). 
</p>
<p>
	A cluster of interpretations is called a <strong>perspective</strong>.
	A cluster of observations is called a <strong>theme</strong>.
</p>
<p>
On this page you will draw your interpretations and/or your observations together
into meaningful groups. Clustering creates a meaningful structure
to your catalysis report. People will be able to look at your report
at a high level (the perspectives or themes), then "drill down" to the details that
lie behind each perspective.
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
First choose a catalysis report to work on. Then, for either interpretations of observations (or both), click the "Start or update clustering diagram" button.
Move the items around, placing like with like. 
</p>
<p>
When you are satisfied
that all of your interpretations/observations are in groups that make sense,
name the groups. For each group, click "New cluster." Give the cluster
a name and description. Once you have named and described all of your
clusters (now called perspectives/themes), you are ready to print
your catalysis report. It will be organized by the clusters
you create here.
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
Should I cluster interpretations or observations?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
It depends on how you are going to use your catalysis report. 
Clustering by interpretations gives strong attention to multiple perspectives on the stories you collected.
If you are using the report in a facilitated workshop, and you want to challenge people to think differently, 
clustering by interpretation can be a great way to break down assumptions and get people thinking in new ways.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, a clustered-interpretations report is longer and somewhat more confusing, especially since observations are repeated 
after each interpretation they are connected to. 
</p>
<p>
So if your ambitions are more modest, or the people you will be working with
might be less enthusiastic about exploring multiple perspectives, or if you just have a lot of information for
people to get through, you might want to group your report by clustering observations. People will
still see multiple interpretations for each observation, but they'll see them <em>after</em> the observation,
which might make them seem less "real" or important.
</p>
<p>
You don't have to choose only one form of clustering, though. You can cluster your observations
<em>and</em> your interpretations. Each type of clustering provides a different type of summary and a different type of insight.
By clustering both ways, you can print both types of report. Then you can use each report in a different situation, or for different
groups who want to work with the patterns differently.

<div class="question">
Do the items have to be inside the cluster bubble to be counted as being
associated with that cluster?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
No. NarraFirma calculates the distance between the center point of each
item and the center point of each cluster. As long as an item
is closer to one cluster center than another, it doesn't matter if it's inside
the cluster "bubble."
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What if an item is not in any cluster?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
It will still go into the report, in the section of the cluster whose center it is closest to. 
If you don't want an item to be included in the report, delete it from the clustering diagram.
