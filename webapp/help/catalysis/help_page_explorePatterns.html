<div class="page-title">Explore patterns</div>
<div class="text">
<p>
This page where you can do narrative catalysis. Here you can look at all of the graphs 
describing your data, make observations about them, and interpret those observations.
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
Start by choosing a catalysis report to work with. Then look at the patterns (graphs) NarraFirma has generated.
Click on a pattern name in the table to see it below the table. 
You can use the arrow buttons to move systematically through the list of patterns.
</p>
<p>
As you are looking at a graph, hover the mouse to see the stories, thus:
<ul>
<li>In a bar graph (one choice question) or histogram (scale question), hover over any 
bar segment to see the story there.</li>
<li>In a table (two choice questions considered together), hover over any 
intersection to see a list of the story names represented by the "bubble" there.</li>
<li>In a scatter plot (two scale questions), hover over any dot to see the 
story it represents.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When you are looking at any graph, click and drag to look at the subset of stories
in any part of the graph. The stories in that selection will appear in the list
under the graph. 
</p>
<p>
If you think a pattern is worth noting in your report, fill in an observation
under the graph, and give the observation a name. Then enter at least two
competing interpretations &mdash; that is, two things reasonable people with different viewpoints might say about
what the observation means.
</p>
<p>
When you look back at the table at the top of the page, you will be able 
to sort it by whether you have marked the graph with an observation.
In that way you can first go through your patterns looking for interesting
patterns, then go back to the patterns you marked to think about them more
deeply.
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">Tips for making the most of this page</div>

<div class="text">
<p>This is the most complicated page in the entire NarraFirma application.
Give yourself some time to learn how to use it effectively. A few tips should help
you manage the complex task of reviewing patterns and writing observations
and interpretations.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Prioritize by sorting</b>. Each of the columns in the table of patterns (at the top of the page) can be used to sort 
		the patterns generated from your data. At different times in your catalysis work you will want to use this sorting 
		function differently. Early on you might want to sort by type of graph. Later you might
		want to see which are the most statistically significant trends. After you have started to 
		write observations for your report, you will want to see which patterns you have written about.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Start with the simpler patterns</b>. It can help to look at your patterns one type at a time. For example, you might start by 
		looking only at the "data integrity" graphs, to see if there are any systematic biases 
		in the answers people gave to questions. Then you might look at the bar graphs (which are simple)
		before moving on to the more complex interactions among questions. (Remember that if a type of graph 
		is not being shown on this page, it doesn't mean you have lost any observations you wrote about 
		those graphs; you will see them again when you view that type of graph again.)
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Eliminate questions that didn't work</b>. It often happens that one or two questions do not result in any useful patterns. 
		The question didn't make sense to people, or it didn't apply to their stories,
		or (most often) there was little variation in the responses.
		Once you are sure that a question is not worth considering, you can 
		uncheck its checkbox on the "Configure catalysis report" page.
		This will reduce the number of patterns generated and streamline your task.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Use observation strengths to triage</b>. 
		You can use the "strength" question about each observation to create a triage system for writing your 
		catalysis report. As you write your observations, give each one a strength value.
		Create a consistent system, like this one:
		<ul><li>
			To be marked as strong, a pattern must be both obvious and surprising to everyone who sees it.</li>
			<li>
				To be marked as medium, a pattern should be hard to dispute and at least moderately interesting.</li>
			</li>
			<li>
				To be marked as weak, a pattern should be either easy to dispute (the numbers are small, 
				the relationship is murky) or not meaningful (perhaps it's a foregone conclusion).
			</li>
		</ul>
		Once you have finished writing your observations, 
		you can sort your patterns list by observation strength, and write 
		interpretations only for the observations marked strongest. 
		Since NarraFirma uses your clustering diagram to organize the catalysis report,
		not writing interpretations for an observation is the same as leaving it out 
		of the report. But you can always get back to your observations again (all of them)
		if you want to review them.
	</li>
</ul>

<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
If I asked a question, and it had a lot of possible answers, and some of the answer counts turned out to be really low, is there
anything I can do about it?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Yes there is. You can export your data (and your story form) to CSV, tell NarraFirma that you want to
consolidate some answers together, and then re-import your data to a new story collection. See the
help file on the <a href="help_page_designStoryForms.html">design story forms</a> page for details on how
to do this.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What do the buttons about the "graph selection" do?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
If you've made a selection of stories in one part of a graph (say in the upper right corner of a
scatter plot), you might want to remember those stories when you look back at your observation
again. Click "Save graph selection to observation," and a representation of what you selected 
will appear in the observation
text box. 
</p>
<p>
When you return to the observation again and want to see the same stories, 
click inside that text representation, then click "Display graph selection selected in observation." 
The same stories should appear in the list. 
</p>
<p>
You can record and use more than one selection in your observation, and you can
(carefully) edit the selections by hand, if you want to.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What statistical tests are being reported?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<ul>
<li>
For a contingency graph (two choice questions), the statistic is the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test">chi-squared test</a>.</li>
<li>For multiple histograms with mutually exclusive choices, 
the test is the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U_test">Mann-Whitney U test</a> 
for differences between means. (The lowest significance level for any pair of subsets is reported.)</li>
<li>
For scatter plots, the test is 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman's_rank_correlation_coefficient">Spearman's ranked correlation coefficient</a>. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman's test are used without testing whether
the data is normally distributed, to be conservative.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What are the extra circles on the "table" diagrams with two choice questions?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Those are the counts of stories that would be in each "cell" of the table
if the two sets of choices were distributed only by chance. You could call
them the "expected" counts, as against the counts actually observed.
Tables of count results where the expected counts are very different
from the observed counts are likely to produce significant test
results from the chi-squared test.
</p>
<p>You can hover your mouse over any of the circles to see how many stories were expected
	to be found there and how many were actually found there.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Why do some of the table rows say "None (choices not mutually exclusive)"?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
That's because some of the tests (chi-squared, Mann-Whitney U) can only be run on mutually exclusive choices. Any questions 
where people could choose more than one answer will have no test values when they 
are combined with other questions.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What are the little colored lines on the histograms?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
The red line is the mean (average) of the distribution. Each of the two green lines
marks one standard deviation away (lower and higher) from the mean.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Help! I deleted an observation, but I didn't mean to, and now the interpretations
I wrote under it are also gone. Can I get it (and them) back?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
You can't get the original name and text back, but your interpretations
still exist. Find the pattern the observation was connected to and write a new
observation name and text. Your interpretations should reappear in a list
under the new name and text.
</p>
</div>
	
<div class="question">
What if I want to write more than one observation per graph? How do I do that?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
You can divide any observation into sections and refer to them in your interpretations.
When you write the observation, begin each section with a <strong>header</strong> that starts
and ends with the @ character (for example, @A@ and @B@, @One@ and @Two@, @first@ and @second@). 
Then refer to the headers in your interpretations. 
When you print your catalysis report, NarraFirma will print only the section of
the observation referred to by the header specified in each interpretation.
You can segment observation titles in the same way.
</p>
<p>
For example, say you write an observation with two parts, like this:
</p>
<pre>
    @A@ There are more stories about cats than about dogs. @B@ The stories people told about cats seem more friendly.
</pre>
<p>And say you give your observation this name:</p>
<pre>
    @A@ More Cats Than Dogs @B@ Cats Better
</pre>
<p>
Now say that one of your interpretations has the text
</p>
<pre>
	@B@ People who have cats are friendlier people.
</pre>
<p>
That means that the interpretation refers to only the part of the observation (and its name) labeled
by the header "B".
When NarraFirma prints your catalysis report, when it gets to your "friendlier people" interpretation, it will print
</p>
<pre>
	People who have cats are friendlier people.
	
		Cats Better

		The stories people told about cats seem more friendly.
</pre>
<p>
These headers, which do not apear in the catalysis report, must be identical in both the interpretation and the observation.
They must be located <i>at the start</i> of the interpretation text, observation text, or observation name. 
They must have @ signs before and after them. 
</p>
<p>Section headers do appear when you print only observations (instead of clustered interpretations), 
	but there the "@" signs are removed, so your header names just look like header names, not secret codes.</p>
</div>
	
<div class="question">
Why should I write two competing interpretations for each observation?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Here is an excerpt from <em><a href="http://www.workingwithstories.org">Working with Stories</a></em>
(from page 272) that can explains why writing competing interpretations
is worth doing.
</p>
<div class="book-quote">
<p>
My placement of the generation of multiple interpretations at the center of catalysis is 
based on my observations of how people react to single interpretations of patterns. When people encounter 
one interpretation, you can see them taking sides: do I agree or don’t I? Their attention 
is on the interpretation, not on their own feelings or beliefs or experiences. They put on their armor 
and prepare to do battle. It’s clear to them that the one interpretation they see is the interpretation 
held by the author of the report: why else would they write it? And as the interpretations build 
throughout the report, people build explanations about the whole report: it’s biased, 
or the author doesn’t know what they are talking about, or the reasoning is flawed. All
of this stops sensemaking short and destroys any hope of productive thought or discussion.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, when you give people two or more <em>competing</em> interpretations of the same pattern, 
they turn their attention away from attacking or defending the interpretations and toward 
<em>exploring their own experiences</em>. This is what you want people to do. You want people to dwell 
on messy ambiguities, and to use them, until they resolve themselves naturally (or don’t). If the 
author of the report has written two interpretations, the reader <em>can’t</em> tell which is the 
author’s own, so there is nothing to attack or defend, and there are no larger explanations about 
bias or ineptitude to build. The report author essentially walks out of the picture 
and lets the reader think. The reader can put away their armor and get out their maps 
and spyglasses. They can explore.
</p>
<p>
Let me give you a more concrete example of how this works. Say I am looking at stories people 
told about their telephone service. Say I’ve seen a pattern that the younger the participant, 
the more likely they were to say they felt disappointed by the events in their story. If I give people 
one interpretation &mdash; that younger people are not happy with their telephone service &mdash; people start 
turning their binary switches off and on. Yes that’s right, no that’s wrong. But what happens if I say 
that younger people might not be happy with their telephone service, or older people might not 
understand the question, or younger people might be more willing to admit to disappointment 
(whereas older people might feel more pressure to say everything’s fine), or younger people 
might be more disappointed about other things and it drifts over, and so on? I’ve marked out a space 
for exploration and invited people on a journey, instead of setting up a straw man to be knocked down.
