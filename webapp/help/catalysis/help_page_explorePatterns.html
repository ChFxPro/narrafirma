<div class="page-title">Explore patterns</div>
<div class="text">
<p>
This page where you can do narrative catalysis. Here you can look at all of the graphs 
describing your data, make observations about them, and interpret those observations.
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
Start by choosing a catalysis report to work with. Then look at the patterns (graphs) NarraFirma has generated.
Click on a pattern name in the table to see it below the table. 
You can use the arrow buttons to move systematically through the list of patterns.
</p>
<p>
As you are looking at a graph, <b>hover the mouse to see the stories</b>, thus:
<ul>
<li>In a <b>bar graph</b> (one choice question) or <b>histogram</b> (scale question), hover over any 
bar segment to see the story there.</li>
<li>In a <b>contingency table</b> (two choice questions considered together), hover over an ellipse to see a list of story names.</li>
<li>In a <b>contingency-histogram table</b> (two choice questions and a scale question considered together), 
	hover over an square to see a list of story names. (The line is the mean of the scale-question distribution,
	and the square around it is one standard deviation to the left and right of the mean.)</li>
<li>In a <b>scatter plot</b> (two scale questions), hover over any dot to see the story (or stories) it represents.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When you are looking at any graph, <b>click and drag to select stories</b>. 
The selected stories will appear in the list under the graph. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>In a <b>bar graph</b> (one choice question) or histogram (scale question), select one or more bars 
		by dragging through their horizontal center points.
		Where you drag vertically doesn't matter.
		You can't select parts of a bar, just the whole thing.
	</li>
	<li>In a <b>contingency table</b> (two choice questions considered together), 
		select any number of ellipses by dragging through their center points.</li>
	<li>In a <b>contingency-histogram table</b> (two choice questions and a scale question considered together), 
		select any number of squares by dragging through their center points.</li>
	<li>In a <b>scatter plot</b> (two scale questions), select stories by dragging through their center points.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you think a pattern is worth noting in your report, fill in an observation
under the graph, and give the observation a name. Then enter at least two
competing interpretations &mdash; that is, two things reasonable people with different viewpoints might say about
what the observation means. Give each interpretation a name as well.
</p>
<p>
When you look back at the table at the top of the page, you will be able 
to sort it by whether you have marked the graph with an observation.
In that way you can first go through your patterns looking for interesting
patterns, then go back to the patterns you marked to think about them more
deeply.
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">Tips for making the most of this page</div>

<div class="text">
<p>This is the most complicated page in the entire NarraFirma application.
Give yourself some time to learn how to use it effectively. A few tips should help
you manage the complex task of reviewing patterns and writing observations
and interpretations.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Prioritize by sorting</b>. Each of the columns in the table of patterns (at the top of the page) can be used to sort 
		the patterns generated from your data. At different times in your catalysis work you will want to use this sorting 
		function differently. Early on you might want to sort by type of graph. Later you might
		want to see which are the most statistically significant trends. After you have started to 
		write observations for your report, you will want to see which patterns you have written about.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Start with the simpler patterns</b>. It can help to look at your patterns one type at a time. For example, you might start by 
		looking only at the "data integrity" graphs, to see if there are any systematic biases 
		in the answers people gave to questions. Then you might look at the bar graphs (which are simple)
		before moving on to the more complex interactions among questions. If a type of graph 
		is not being shown on this page, it doesn't mean you have lost any observations you wrote about 
		those graphs; you will see them again when you view that type of graph again.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Eliminate questions that didn't work</b>. It often happens that one or two questions do not result in any useful patterns. 
		The question didn't make sense to people, or it didn't apply to their stories,
		or (most often) there was little variation in the responses.
		Once you are sure that a question is not worth considering, you can 
		uncheck its checkbox on the "Configure catalysis report" page.
		This will reduce the number of patterns generated and streamline your task.
	</li>
	<li><b>Write tentative observations</b>. If you think you <i>might</i> want to write an observation for a graph, but but you're not sure,
		make a tentative observation by putting some kind of special code in the observation name text box, like "?" or "maybe"
		or "later". Then, later on, come back to all of your tentative observations and decide whether you want
		to finish writing them. If an observation has no interpretations associated with it, it will not appear on the 
		"Cluster interpretations" page or in the printed report (at least not in the "clustered interpretations" report).
		So you can write tentative observations and then simply abandon them later.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Use observation strengths to triage</b>. 
		You can use the "strength" question about each observation to create a triage system for writing your 
		catalysis report. As you write your observations, give each one a strength value.
		Create a consistent system, like this one:
		<ul><li>
			To be marked as strong, a pattern must be both obvious and surprising to everyone who sees it.</li>
			<li>
				To be marked as medium, a pattern should be hard to dispute and at least moderately interesting.</li>
			</li>
			<li>
				To be marked as weak, a pattern should be either easy to dispute (the numbers are small, 
				the relationship is murky) or not meaningful (perhaps it's a foregone conclusion).
			</li>
		</ul>
		Once you have finished writing your observations, 
		you can sort your patterns list by observation strength, and write 
		interpretations only for the observations marked strongest. 
		Since NarraFirma uses your clustering diagram to organize the catalysis report,
		not writing interpretations for an observation is the same as leaving it out 
		of the report. But you can always go back to your observations again 
		if you want to review them.
	</li>
	<li><b>Give everything a name</b>. Make sure all of your observations and interpretations have clear, brief names. They are used as headers in
		the printed report. Interpretation names are also used to represent interpretations on the clustering diagram.
	</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
What are the extra circles on the "table" diagrams with two choice questions?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Those are the counts of stories that would be in each "cell" of the table
if the two sets of choices were distributed only by chance. You could call
them the "expected" counts, as against the counts actually observed.
Tables of count results where the expected counts are very different
from the observed counts are likely to produce significant test
results from the chi-squared test.
</p>
<p>You can hover your mouse over any of the circles to see how many stories were expected
to be found there and how many were actually found there.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What are the lines and squares on the "contingency-histogram" graphs?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
The line is the mean of the distribution for the scale question shown.
The smaller box around the line shows one standard deviation to the left and right of the mean.
The height of the box shows the relative number of stories in that category.
</p>
<p>You can hover your mouse over any of the squares to see how many stories are in that
combination (of two choice questions and one scale question), and what the exact values are for the
mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of the distribution.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What are the little colored lines on the histograms?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
The red line is the mean (average) of the distribution. Each of the two green lines
marks one standard deviation away (lower and higher) from the mean.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
	Is it absolutely necessary to see all of the statistical results? They are really annoying.
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>You can hide them. 
	Go to the "Configure catalysis report" page and uncheck the check box under "Would you prefer to see statistical results directly on the Explore patterns page?"
	Then come back to the Explore patterns page and look at your graphs again; they will not show any statistical results.
	You can still see the statistical results by choosing "Show statistical results" in the "things you can do" list and clicking 'Do it.'
</p><p>
	Note: when you hide statistical results, the HTML elements (divs) that show the statistical results are actually still on the page. 
	They just have their "display" options set to "none". If you wanted temporarily show a statistical-results panel (maybe for a screenshot or something), 
	you could open your browser's development console, inspect the graph whose panel you want to show, find the hidden statistical panel, and turn off its "display: none" option.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
	What does it mean where it says "These are selections you have saved for this graph"?  What do the options for "save the current selection" and "restore a saved selection" do?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
If you've made a selection of stories in one part of a graph (say in the upper right corner of a
scatter plot), you might want to remember those stories when you look back at your observation
again. Under the graph, choose "Save the current selection," then click "Do it." A text representation of what you selected 
will appear in the "These are the selections you have saved" text box. 
</p>
<p>
When you return to the observation again and want to see the same stories, 
click inside the text representation of the selection in the "These are the selections you have saved" text box.
Then choose "Restore a saved selection" and click "Do it."" 
The same stories should appear in the list. 
</p>
<p>
You can record and use more than one selection, and you can
(carefully) edit the text representations by hand, if you want to.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
	What are linking questions for?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
	<p>Linking questions help readers of your catalysis report understand <strong>how each observation is connected to its interpretations</strong>. 
		They do this by framing a question to which your interpretations are answers.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>In a perspectives (clustered-interpretations) report, an observation's linking question is printed just before each of its interpretations.
			In this case, the question serves as a quick summary of the observation that helps people understand what the interpretation refers to.
		</li>
		<li>In a themes (clustered-observations) report, an observation's linking question is printed between the observation and its interpretations.
			In this case, the question is less a summary than an introduction to the array of answers represented by the interpretations.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Without linking questions, you might end up starting each interpretation with the same question. Writing linking questions
		saves you that bother, and it makes your report more clear.
	</p>
</div>
	
<div class="question">
Help! I deleted an observation, but I didn't mean to, and now the interpretations
I wrote under it are also gone. Can I get it (and them) back?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
You can't get the original name and text back, but your interpretations
still exist. Find the pattern the observation was connected to and write a new
observation name and text. Your interpretations should reappear in a list
under the new name and text.
</p>
</div>
	
<div class="question">
I want to write two observations about one pattern. How can I do that?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
	When we first started working on NarraFirma, it never occurred to us that people would want to write more than one observation per pattern.
	When we found out that some people did want to do that, we decided not to change the one-observation-per-pattern system, for three reasons:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>You really don't need to do this very often.</li>
	<li>It would make the most complicated page in the application a lot more complicated.</li>
	<li>It would be difficult to change the way observations are stored without breaking backward compatibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	So you can write more than one observation per pattern, but it's a little messy.
You can <strong>divide an observation into sections</strong> and refer to those sections (rather than the whole observation) in your interpretations.
Here is how to do it.
</p><p>
When you write the observation (that is, its main text), begin each section with a <strong>header</strong> that starts
and ends with the @ character (for example, @A@ and @B@). 
Then refer to the headers in your interpretations (in their main texts, not their names). 
</p>
<p>
When you print your catalysis report, NarraFirma will act <strong>as if the sections were separate observations</strong>.
You can also segment observation titles and linking questions.
</p>
<p>
For example, say you write an observation with two parts, like this:
</p>
<pre>
	@A@ There are more stories about cats than about dogs. 
	@B@ The stories people told about cats seem more friendly.
</pre>
<p>And say you give your observation this name:</p>
<pre>
	@A@ More Cats Than Dogs @B@ Cat Stories More Friendly
</pre>
<p>And this linking question:</p>
<pre>
	@A@ Why are there more cats than dogs? @B@ Why are the stories about cats friendlier?
</pre>
<p>
Now say your interpretations look like this:
</p>
<pre>
	@A@ Because cats are better than dogs.
	@A@ Because cats live longer than dogs.
	@B@ Because people who have cats are friendlier people.
	@B@ Because the interviewer has a cat, so the people they talked to felt more at home.
</pre>
<p>
The clustered-interpretations catalysis report will look like this: 
</p>
<pre>
	Why are there more cats than dogs? Because cats are better than dogs.
		More Cats Than Dogs: There are more stories about cats than about dogs.

	Why are there more cats than dogs? Because cats live longer than dogs.
		More Cats Than Dogs: There are more stories about cats than about dogs.

	Why are the stories about cats friendlier? Because people who have cats are friendlier people.
		Cat Stories More Friendly: The stories people told about cats seem more friendly.

	Why are the stories about cats friendlier? Because the interviewer has a cat, so the people they talked to felt more at home.
		Cat Stories More Friendly: The stories people told about cats seem more friendly.
</pre>
<p>And the clustered-observations report will look like this:</p>
<pre>
	More Cats Than Dogs: There are more stories about cats than about dogs.
		Why are there more cats than dogs? 
			Because cats are better than dogs.
			Because cats live longer than dogs.

	Cat Stories More Friendly: The stories people told about cats seem more friendly.
		Why are the stories about cats friendlier? 
			Because people who have cats are friendlier people.
			Because the interviewer has a cat, so the people they talked to felt more at home.
</pre>
<p>
These headers:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>must have @ signs before and after them</li>
	<li>can be anything you want inside those @ signs (first/second, 1/2, a/b, hey/ho, off/we go)</li>
	<li>will not appear in the report</li>
	<li>must be <i>identical</i> in the interpretation and observation</li>
	<li>must be located <i>at the very start</i> of the interpretation text, observation text, observation name, or linking question</li>
	<li>should not appear in any other field of the interpretation (just its main text)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few limitations with this segemented-texts approach. When you cluster observations,
	you will have <i>only one bubble</i> to cluster with (so both segments have to be in the same theme). 
	Also, you cannot set different observation strengths for the different parts of the observation.
	Still, if you really want to say two things about a graph, this is how to do it.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
I want to write one observation about two patterns. How can I do that?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
You're in luck, because this is easy. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Under the box where you describe your observation, find the box labeled "To include additional patterns".</li>
	<li>For each pattern you want to include, find its line in the patterns table at the top of the page. </li>
	<li>Copy the <i>exact</i> name of each question in the pattern. (Patterns can have one, two, or three question names.) </li>
	<li>If there is only one question in the pattern, just type that exact name into the additional-patterns box. </li>
	<li>If there is more than one question in the pattern, type the names in the same order as they appear in the 
		patterns table (where it says Question 1, Question 2, Question 3). 
		Separate the question names by typing double equals signs between them, for example "Feel about == How long remember."</li>
</ul>
<p>
	When NarraFirma prints your report, it will print the additional patterns you specified just after the pattern
	associated with the observation. You can include as many additional patterns as you like; just make sure each one is described on its own line of text.
</p>
<p>
There is a "secret" trick to this function. If the very first additional pattern name (on the first line of the box) reads <i>exactly</i> REPLACE_PATTERN,
NarraFirma will <i>hide</i> the graph the observation is linked to. This means that you can <i>substitute</i> other patterns
for the pattern that is supposed to be drawn for an observation. Why would you want to do this? Because it gives you another
way to write more than one observation per pattern. Instead of segmenting an observation, you can "steal" an observation space
from another pattern. 
</p>
</div>


<div class="question">
I've got some observations written, but I've suddenly realized that I have to change something about my stories.
Do I have to start all over again? 
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
If you need to change your stories but do not need to create a new story collection, you can just go ahead and
change your stories. Be sure to go back over your observations to see if you need to revise them.
</p>
<p>
	If you need to start a new story collection, perhaps because you discovered an import mistake, you can still fix the problem. 
	Scroll to the bottom of
	the "Configure catalysis report" page, and click "Export report elements to CSV." This will write out a CSV file
	with all of the observations, interpretations, and perspectives you have created in the report.
	Then create your new story collection, create a new catalyis report, scroll down to the bottom of 
	the "Configure catalysis report" page again, and click "Import report elements from CSV." As long as the 
	question short names match between the two story collections (or both sets of story collections), 
	the report elements will connect up correctly. There is a fuller explanation of this feature 
	in the help page for the <a href="help_page_configureCatalysisReport.html">Configure catalysis report</a> page.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
If I asked a question, and it had a lot of possible answers, and some of the answer counts turned out to be really low, is there
anything I can do about it?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Yes there is. You can export your data (and your story form) to CSV, tell NarraFirma that you want to
consolidate some answers together, and then re-import your data to a new story collection. See the
help page on the <a href="help_page_designStoryForms.html">design story forms</a> page for details on how
to do this.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What statistical tests are being reported?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<ul>
<li>
For a contingency graph (two choice questions), the statistic is the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test">chi-squared test</a>.</li>
<li>For multiple histograms with mutually exclusive choices, 
the test is the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U_test">Mann-Whitney U test</a> 
for differences between means. (The lowest significance level for any pair of subsets is reported.)</li>
<li>
For scatter plots, the test is 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman's_rank_correlation_coefficient">Spearman's ranked correlation coefficient</a>. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman's test are used without testing whether
the data is normally distributed, to be conservative.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What is skewness? What is kurtosis?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
	Skewness is a measure of how far the distribution is skewed away from being symmetrical. 
	Positive skewness means the bulk of the values are on the left (and the right tail is longer). 
	Negative skewness means the bulk of the values are on the right (and the left tail is longer).
</p>
<img src="help_skewness.png" width="200">
<p>Kurtosis is a measure of how peaked or flat a distribution is.
	Positive kurtosis means the distribution is strongly peaked.
	Negative kurtosis means the distribution is flattened. 
</p>
<img src="help_kurtosis.png" width="200">
</div>

<div class="question">
Why do some of the table rows say "None (choices not mutually exclusive)"?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
That's because some of the tests (chi-squared, Mann-Whitney U) can only be run on mutually exclusive choices. 
Any questions where people could choose more than one answer will have no test values when they 
are combined with other questions.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Why should I write two competing interpretations for each observation?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Here is an excerpt from <em><a href="http://www.workingwithstories.org">Working with Stories</a></em>
(from page 272) that can explains why writing competing interpretations
is worth doing.
</p>
<div class="book-quote">
<p>
My placement of the generation of multiple interpretations at the center of catalysis is 
based on my observations of how people react to single interpretations of patterns. When people encounter 
one interpretation, you can see them taking sides: do I agree or don’t I? Their attention 
is on the interpretation, not on their own feelings or beliefs or experiences. They put on their armor 
and prepare to do battle. It’s clear to them that the one interpretation they see is the interpretation 
held by the author of the report: why else would they write it? And as the interpretations build 
throughout the report, people build explanations about the whole report: it’s biased, 
or the author doesn’t know what they are talking about, or the reasoning is flawed. All
of this stops sensemaking short and destroys any hope of productive thought or discussion.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, when you give people two or more <em>competing</em> interpretations of the same pattern, 
they turn their attention away from attacking or defending the interpretations and toward 
<em>exploring their own experiences</em>. This is what you want people to do. You want people to dwell 
on messy ambiguities, and to use them, until they resolve themselves naturally (or don’t). If the 
author of the report has written two interpretations, the reader <em>can’t</em> tell which is the 
author’s own, so there is nothing to attack or defend, and there are no larger explanations about 
bias or ineptitude to build. The report author essentially walks out of the picture 
and lets the reader think. The reader can put away their armor and get out their maps 
and spyglasses. They can explore.
</p>
<p>
Let me give you a more concrete example of how this works. Say I am looking at stories people 
told about their telephone service. Say I’ve seen a pattern that the younger the participant, 
the more likely they were to say they felt disappointed by the events in their story. If I give people 
one interpretation &mdash; that younger people are not happy with their telephone service &mdash; people start 
turning their binary switches off and on. Yes that’s right, no that’s wrong. But what happens if I say 
that younger people might not be happy with their telephone service, or older people might not 
understand the question, or younger people might be more willing to admit to disappointment 
(whereas older people might feel more pressure to say everything’s fine), or younger people 
might be more disappointed about other things and it drifts over, and so on? I’ve marked out a space 
for exploration and invited people on a journey, instead of setting up a straw man to be knocked down.
