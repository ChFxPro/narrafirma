Choose a story collection, click on a story, click Edit, and <b>answer the questions you created</b>. Then click the right arrow button to 
answer the questions for the next story. Keep doing this until you have gone through all of your stories.

<p>
Note that when you answer annotation questions, you don't have to click the Close button to move to the next story in the list. 
The special <b>mass editing mode</b> on this page (and this page alone) helps you move more quickly as you work your way through your stories.

Below the list of stories, you can see graphs of your answer counts.

<div class="question">
I have too many stories to answer annotation questions for all of them! What should I do?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
	<p>
		It might not take as long as you think it will. Annotation usually starts out slow but speeds up as you work through your stories. 
		Still, if you have thousands of stories, you might need to trim your annotation ambitions. Here are some ideas that could help.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Triage your annotation questions. Cut down the list to the bare minimum. Try out each question on ten or twenty stories. Evaluate which questions seem the most useful in small subsets of stories.
			It's always hard to guess whether you will find patterns in annotation questions, but with a little exploration you can get an intuitive feel for which questions seem the most worth pursuing.
		</li>
		<li>Figure out how long it will take to answer your annotation questions for one story, on average. 
			The process will speed up later on, so discount the time by a quarter or a third.
			Then make an educated guess as to how many stories you will be able to annotate given the time you have.
			For example, if it will take you three minutes to annotate each story, and you have 300 stories, you will need (3x300)/60 = 15 hours to do your annotations.
			Can you spend that much time? If not, what do you want to cut down? The number of questions? The number of stories?
			To draw interesting and useful graphs, and to run statistical tests, it is best to generate data for at least 100 stories. 
			So, how long would it take you to annotate 100 stories? (For the above example, it would be 5 hours.) Can you do that? 
		</li>
		<li>If you think you will have enough time to annotate some but not all of your stories, 
			annotate a random sample of stories. Below the list of stories on the "Annotate stories" page is a "Random" button. 
			Keep clicking that button and answering questions until you have used up your annotation time. 
		</li>
		<li>If you can't afford the time to annotate even a subset of your stories, see if you can get some help. 
			Find some friends, family members, or colleagues to help you. 
			Explain how you plan to ensure that your annotation process is rigorous, ethical, and transparent. 
			Then have each person do the same thing you're doing: click the Random button, answer the questions, repeat. 
			(If you use this option, be sure to add a "who annotated this" question to check for inter-rater reliability.)
			When you have all reached your limit of time or patience, see how many stories you have annotated. Then look at your graphs.</li>

<div class="question">
	Do you have any tips to make annotating stories go faster?
	</div>
	<div class="question-answer">
		<p>A few. Try these ideas:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You can use the story table's column headers to sort stories by their annotation answers. This can be a big help when you are 
				consolidating lists of answers. For example, if you need to decide whether you should merge two answers, you can skim through the stories
				marked with each answer to make your decision. 
			</li>
			<li>If you need to find a story but can't remember its name or where it was in the list of stories, use your browser's text-search function to search the web page
				for any words you remember from the story. The texts of all of your stories are in the table, so a general text search will help you find the story you want to find.
			</li>
			<li>If you are working on emergent sets of answers, you may find yourself unsure of what to mark for some of your stories.
				Should you create a new answer, choose an existing answer, or leave the question blank?
				To help with such quandaries, you can use annotation questions to keep track of "problem stories." 
				For example, you could create a free-text "Notes" annotation question and use it to
				leave yourself reminders on issues you need to resolve. The reminders will appear (as a column) in your table of stories,
				and you can sort the stories by them. 
				Or you could set up a "Resolved?" annotation question, with answers like "firm," "tentative," and "problematical."
				Creating patterns to graph is only one of the things you can do with annotation questions.
				You can also use them to improve your annotation process.
			</li>
			<li>If you are sharing the annotation task with another person, you can divide up the stories using their index numbers in the table.
				For example, if you and I were annotating 100 stories, you might confine yourself to the first 50 while I handle the last 50.
				Also, we might agree to only add new answers while we work, then consolidate our answers together.
			</li>
			<li>It can be annoying to have to keep scrolling up and down the page as you fill in answers and look at your graphs of evolving answers.
				Your browser might have a key combination that makes this easier. Try out clicking on various parts of the page
				and hitting the Control (or Command) key, plus the up and down arrows, to see if you can jump up and down more easily. 
			</li>
		</ul>
