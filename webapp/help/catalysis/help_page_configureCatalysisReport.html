<div class="question">
Can you explain the different graph types?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>The graph types are described in detail on the <a href="help_page_explorePatterns.html">Explore patterns</a> 
help page.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
How should I set the subset threshold for statistical tests? 
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
If you have lots of stories, you might
want to strengthen the results of your statistical tests by removing all small
story subsets from comparison. The higher this threshold the stronger (and fewer) your statistical results will be.
Be aware that choosing a threshold below 30 will result in test results with weaker power, which
can only be considered suggestive, not conclusive.
</p>
</div>
		
<div class="question">
What if I change my mind about the statistical threshold later?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Changing your statistical threshold might
change some test values. If you do change this value, be careful to update any
observations you've already written that depend on statistical test values.
</div>
<div class="question">

Why would I want to hide graph types from view?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Looking at all of the graphs for your project might be overwhelming; sometimes there are thousands. 
You might want to reduce the number of graphs you consider at once.
Perhaps you would like to start your catalysis work just by looking at data integrity,
or only bar graphs, or something. You can move back and forth between this page and the next to see only the graphs you want to
concentrate on right now. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Why would I want to hide questions from view?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Sometimes questions don't turn out to be very useful, 
because participants didn't understand them, or the answer possibilities you gave didn't appeal to participants,
or there wasn't as much variety as you expected to find.
For whatever reason, you may not want to include every question from your story form
in your catalysis report. If you can't see a question on the <a href="help_page_explorePatterns.html">Explore Patterns</a> page, you
can't write any observations about it. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
	What's this about filtering stories?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
	<p>You can use a filter to <b>limit the scope of your catalysis report</b> to a specific subset of stories.
		This feature is useful when you have an important division in your story collection, such as when your stories were collected in different locations
		and you need to look at patterns within as well as among locations. (Some people call this "slicing" data.)
	</p><p>
		To create a filter, enter the <i>exact</i> short name of a question in your story form, 
		followed by <b>two equals signs</b> (==), 
		followed by either a list of <i>exact</i> answers (separated by two equals signs), or
		the low and high values of a numerical range (separated by two equals signs). 
		</p>
		<p>Some examples:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Feel about == happy</b> will include only stories for which the question "Feel about" was answered "happy."</li>
			<li><b>Location == Northern == Eastern</b> will include stories for which the "Location" question was answered either "Northern" or "Eastern."</li>
			<li><b>Story ended == 0 == 20</b> will include stories for which the scale question "Story ended" was answered with a number in the range from zero to twenty (inclusive).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To negate a query, write an exclamation point just before the name of the question. For example:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>!Feel about == happy</b> will include only stories for which the question "Feel about" was answered with any <i>other</i> answer than "happy."</li>
			<li><b>!Location == Northern == Eastern</b> will include stories for which the "Location" question was anything <i>but</i> "Northern" or "Eastern."</li>
			<li><b>!Story ended == 0 == 20</b> will include stories for which the scale question "Story ended" was answered with a number <i>outside</i> the range from zero to twenty (inclusive).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You can filter by more than one question. 
			Separate the two questions with two ampersands (&&). 
			For example:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Feel about == happy && Story ended == 0 == 20</b> will include stories for which the question "Feel about" was answered "happy" 
				<i>and</i> the scale question "Story ended" was answered with a number in the range from zero to twenty (inclusive).</li>
			<li><b>Feel about == happy && !Feel about == sad</b> will include stories for which the question "Feel about" was answered "happy" 
				<i>and</i> the question "Feel about" (yes you can specify the same question twice) was not answered "sad."</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Tips on writing filters:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You can use these question types in a filter: boolean, checkbox, checkboxes, select, radiobuttons, slider. 
				You cannot use these question types in a filter: label, header, text, textarea.
			</li>
			<li>For a <b>boolean</b> question, the answer specified in your filter must be either "yes" or "no." </li>
			<li>For a <b>checkbox</b> question, the answer must be either "true" or "false."</li>
			<li>For a <b>slider</b>, you <i>must</i> specify both ends of the range. Scale ranges must be inclusive.</li>
			<li>You can't filter on the number of stories told. It's not a normal question; it's generated.</li>
			<li>Spaces around the equals signs and ampersands are optional. They get trimmed off.</li>
			<li>Why <i>two</i> equals signs? Why <i>two</i> ampersands? Because you might have one equals sign or ampersand in a question name or answer.</li>
			<li>If you have multiple story collections in your catalysis report, all matching stories will be included, as long as the question and answer names match (exactly).</li>
			<li><b>Don't forget that you set a filter!</b> 
			At the top of each remaining page in the catalysis section (explore patterns, cluster interpretations, print catalysis report),
			just below the name of the catalysis report, you will see a
			<b>reminder</b> that you are only considering a subset of the stories in your story collection(s). 
			The same reminder appears in the printed catalysis report.</li>
			<li>You can use the number of stories reported in the reminder to <b>check that your filter is working properly</b>. 
			If you want to be <i>really</i> sure that you have only the stories you want in your report, check the graph for the question.
			The answers you filtered out should be missing from the graph.</li>

<div class="question">
	How does <b>display lumping</b> work?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
	<p>
		You can lump answers permanently as you import your data from a CSV file.
		(See the <a href="../collection/help_page_importGuide.html">Import guide</a> to learn how to do that.)
		However, NarraFirma also supports <b>display lumping</b> -- that is, changing your catalysis graphs <i>without</i> 
		changing your stored data. 
	</p>
	<p>
		To use display lumping, go to the <b>Configure catalysis report</b> page and find the box labeled
		"If you want to use <strong>display lumping</strong> for choice questions, enter your lumping commands here."
		In that box, for each set of answers you want to lump together, on its own line,
		enter 
		<ul>
			<li>the <i>exact</i> short name of the question, </li>
			<li>two equals signs (==), </li>
			<li>a list of the <i>exact</i> answers you want to lump together, separated by two pipe characters (||), then</li>
			<li>two equals signs again, and finally</li>
			<li>the name of the new merged answer. </li>
		</ul>
	<p>
		For example: 
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>If you enter <b>Feel about == satisfied || relieved == positive</b>, NarraFirma will count the answers "satisfied" or "relieved" to the 
		question "Feel about" as "positive."</li>
	<li>If you enter <b>Feel about == frustrated || angry == negative</b>, NarraFirma will count the answers "frustrated" or "angry" to the 
			question "Feel about" as "negative."</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Tips on display lumping:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Spaces around the equals signs and pipe characters are optional. They get trimmed off.</li>
			<li>Why <i>two</i> equals signs? Why <i>two</i> pipe characters? Because you might have one equals sign or pipe character in a question name or answer.</li>
			<li>If you have multiple story collections in your catalysis report, display lumping will apply to all of them, as long as the question and answer names match.</li>
			<li>Display lumping only affects the graphs drawn in the Catalysis portion of NarraFirma,
				on the "Explore patterns" page and in your catalysis report. 
				The Collection portion of NarraFirma (the "Spot-check graphs" page) shows your unlumped data.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you make changes to your lumping scheme <i>after</i> you have written some observations, 
				make sure you <b>check to see whether your observations need to change</b>. 
				NarraFirma cannot tell that you have changed the way your graphs are drawn. 
				You need to keep track of that yourself.
			</li>
			<li>You can only use display lumping with questions of the types <b>checkboxes</b>, <b>radio buttons</b>, and <b>select</b>.
				You cannot use it with questions of the types boolean, checkbox, slider, label, header, text, and textarea. 
			</li>
			<li>You can use display lumping with all of the <b>questions NarraFirma generates</b>: 
				Eliciting question, Number of stories told, Story length, and Collection date.
				For example, lumping commands for collection dates might look like this:
				<ul>
					<li>Collection date == 2021-02-14 || 2021-02-15 || 2021-02-16 == Pulse 1</li>
					<li>Collection date == 2021-03-05 || 2021-03-06 || 2021-03-07 == Pulse 2</li>
					<li>Collection date == 2021-05-12 || 2021-05-13 || 2021-05-14 == Pulse 3</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
</div>

<div class="question">
	Why is <b>display lumping</b> useful?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
	<p>
	The catalysis process almost always requires that you choose some answers to lump together. 
	Why? Because when you give people a list of answers to choose from, you will often find that some answers gather few responses. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Let's say that I asked people how they felt about their story, and I got a distribution of answers like this:
	</p>
	<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
		<tr><td>satisfied - 62</td><td>relieved - 29</td><td>frustrated - 18</td><td>angry - 14</td></tr>
	</table>
	<p>
	Every statistical test has a low-count cutoff. Many won't run if the counts to be compared 
	are less than twenty. With this distribution, I can't run a test to detect statistical differences
	between positive and negative answer counts, because my "frustrated" and "angry" counts are each less than 20.
	However, if I <i>combine</i> the two negative-answer counts (frustrated and angry) together, I can create this distribution:
	</p>
	<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
		<tr><td>satisfied - 62</td><td>relieved - 29</td><td>negative - 32</td></tr>
	</table>
	<p>I <i>can</i> use statistical tests to compare those counts.</p>
	<p>
	If your project has a lot of stories in it, you may think you can ignore lumping. But if you want to slice and dice your data 
	into categories (by province, age, position, etc), you could still end up with low counts for some answers. 
	To take another example, the chi-squared test (used in contingency tables) cannot be calculated if <i>any</i> of the table cell counts is less than five.
	So you can't run it on a table like this one because of the one cell that has only four stories in it.
	<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
		<tr><td> </td><td colspan="4">Need</td></tr>
		<tr><td rowspan="5">Position</td><td> </td><td>information</td><td>help</td><td>respect</td></tr>
		<tr><td>staff</td><td>39</td><td>19</td><td>24</td></tr>
		<tr><td>sales</td><td>12</td><td>10</td><td>48</td></tr>
		<tr><td>manager</td><td>26</td><td>21</td><td><b>4</b></td></tr>
		<tr><td>executive</td><td>15</td><td>32</td><td>18</td></tr>
	</table>
	<p>In this case, lumping together the managers and executives, or help and respect, would improve the situation. Whether that's 
		a good idea (should those categories be lumped together?) is one of the decisions you make as you go through
		the catalysis process.

<div class="question">
What happens to my observations when I hide a graph type or question?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Any question or graph type you uncheck here will not show up on the 
<a href="help_page_explorePatterns.html">Explore patterns</a> page.
However, if you write an observation about a pattern and then hide its question or graph type, the observation will
still appear in the printed report. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
		What's this about an opaque dot?
		</div>
		<div class="question-answer">
		<p>
		If you have a lot of data points, or if you imported data collected with a different slider scale, you may
		end up in a situation where one dot on a scatterplot represents not one but several (or many) stories. In that situation,
		you can make scatter-plot dots semi-transparent, so a dark dot represents more stories than a pale dot.  
		</p>

<div class="question">
	Please explain exporting and importing report elements. 
	</div>
	<div class="question-answer">
	<p>
	A catalysis report contains observations, interpretations, and perspectives that refer to patterns (graphs or sets of graphs) in the story collection(s) connected to that report.
	Sometimes it happens that you need to change a story form or story collection <i>after</i> you have started working on a catalysis report.
	To avoid having to start the report all over again, you can <b>copy its observations, interpretations, and perspectives to a new report</b>.</p>
	<p>To do this:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>At the bottom of the "Configure catalysis report" page, with your catalysis report selected, click <b>Export report elements to CSV</b>.</li>
		<li>Create one or more new story collections (maybe with new story forms).</li>
		<li>Create a new catalysis report using those story collections.</li>
		<li>At the bottom of the "Configure catalysis report" page, with your new, empty catalysis report selected, click <b>Import report elements from CSV</b>.</li>
		<li>Choose the CSV file you saved.</li>
		<li>Check over your observations. If you think the patterns might have changed, check over your imported observations to see if they still make sense.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Two important warnings:</p>
	<ul>
			<li>
					<b>Always import report elements into a new, empty catalysis report</b>. NarraFirma does not check for collisions with existing
					observations, interpretations, or perspectives. 
				</li>
				<li>NarraFirma has no idea (and does not care) if your imported report elements make any sense with the new data you are connecting them to. 
						If your data is different in the new story collection,
						<b>it is up to you to go over each observation and see whether it still makes sense</b>.
					</li>
					
	</ul>
	<p>Notes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Observations are identified by their connections to patterns. Patterns are combinations of questions. Questions are identified by their short names.
			Interpretations depend on observations. Perspectives depend on interpretations.
			Thus the critical connection between two catalysis reports lies in the short names of the questions their patterns refer to.
			So you can transfer elements from one catalysis report to another 
			<i>as long as the question short names are identical</i>. 
		</li>
		<li>
			The question <i>types</i> must also be identical, 
			because different patterns would be generated if you changed, for example, a choice question to a scale question.
			(Though it won't matter if a question changes from a single-choice to a multiple-choice answer; as long as the same graph types will be generated, the mapping will work.)
		</li>
		<li>
			It does not matter if question texts or answer lists are different in the two situations. 
			Those things are not involved in the connections between observations and patterns.
		It also does not matter if you are working in a new project when you import report elements. The only thing that matters is that the
				question short names (and types) match up.
			</li>
		<li>If the question short names are <i>not</i> identical in the two reports,
			you can carefully edit the question short names in your exported CSV file to match those in the new situation. 
			Be sure to change the question short names in the "Pattern" column as well as the "Question #" columns.
			And make sure you preserve the prefixes in front of question names:
			<ul>
				<li>S_ for story questions</li>
				<li>P_ for participant questions</li>
				<li>A_ for annotation questions</li>
			</ul> 
			Remember to save the CSV file using the UTF-8 encoding format.
		</li>
	</ul>
