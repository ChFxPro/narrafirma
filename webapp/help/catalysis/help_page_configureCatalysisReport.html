Use this page to exclude some questions and sample sizes from your
catalysis report. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
Choose a lower threshold for story subsets. Twenty is a good default for most projects.
</p>
<p>
Choose which questions you want to include in your catalysis report.
Any questions left unchecked here will not appear in the 
<a href="help_page_explorePatterns.html">Explore patterns</a> page.
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
How should I set the subset threshold for statistical tests? 
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
If you have lots of stories, you might
want to strengthen the results of your statistical tests by removing all small
story subsets from comparison. The higher this threshold the stronger (and fewer) your statistical results will be.
Be aware that choosing a threshold below 30 will result in test results with weaker power, which
can only be considered suggestive, not conclusive.
</p>
</div>
		
<div class="question">
What if I change my mind about the statistical threshold later?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Changing your statistical threshold might
change some test values. If you do change this value, be careful to update any
observations you've already written that depend on statistical test values.
</div>
<div class="question">

Why would I want to hide graph types from view?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Looking at all of the graphs for your project might be overwhelming; sometimes there are thousands. 
You might want to reduce the number of graphs you consider at once.
Perhaps you would like to start your catalysis work just by looking at data integrity,
or only bar graphs, or something. You can move back and forth between this page and the next to see only the graphs you want to
concentrate on right now. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Why would I want to hide questions from view?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Sometimes questions don't turn out to be very useful, 
because people didn't understand them, or the answer possibilities you gave didn't appeal to people,
or there wasn't as much variety as you expected to find.
For whatever reason, you may not want to include every question from your story form
in your catalysis report. If you can't see a question on the <a href="help_page_explorePatterns.html">Explore Patterns</a> page, you
can't write any observations about it. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What happens to my observations when I hide a graph type or question?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
Any question or graph type you uncheck here will not show up on the 
<a href="help_page_explorePatterns.html">Explore patterns</a> page.
However, if you write an observation about a pattern and then hide its question or graph type, the observation will
still appear in the printed report. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What's this about an opaque dot?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
If you have a lot of data points, or if you imported data collected with a different slider scale, you may
end up in a situation where one dot on a scatterplot represents not one but several (or many) stories. In that situation,
you can make scatter-plot dots semi-transparent, so a dark dot represents more stories than a pale dot.
