<li>Collection: Set up your questions and collect stories in person or over the web.</li>
<li>Catalysis: Prepare some "food for thought" for people to use in working with the stories you have collected.</li>
<li>Sensemaking: Guide people through working with the stories you have collected.</li>
<li>Intervention: Optionally, design one or more interventions to guide the flow of stories.</li>
<li>Return: Gather information about your project -- impact and reflect on what you have learned.
