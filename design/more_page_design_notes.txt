KEEP THIS for help text later - on deriving story elements

"
1. Choose one or two types of story element (characters, situations, values, themes, relationships, motivations, beliefs, conflicts).
2. For each story, come up with as many answers to that element's question as you can. Write the answers on sticky notes.

The questions are:

Characters: Who is doing things in this story?
Situations: What is going on in this story?
Values: What matters to the characters in this story?
Themes: What is this story about?
Relationships: How are the characters related in this story?
Motivations: Why do the characters do what they do in this story?
Beliefs: What do people believe in this story?
Conflicts: Who or what stands in opposition in this story?

3. Once you have answered the question(s) you chose for each story, cluster the sticky notes into groups. Place like with like.

4. Give each group of sticky notes a name.

5. Clear a "halo" of space around each group's name.

6. In the halo, write 2-5 good and bad attributes (advantages and disadvantages, opportunities and dangers) of each group of sticky notes.

7. Copy or move the new good/bad attributes to a new space. Mix them all together.

8. Cluster the attributes into groups.

9. Name the groups. These are your story elements.

// these are ALL the grids in the program (or this list could be programmatically created on the fly which is probably better)
// they should pick which grid they want to draw from (with a drop down)
// after they pick the grid from the dropdown, the grid they picked should appear below it
// and they can pick one (or more?) item in the grid, then click OK, then the grid item should appear in the "presentation elements" grid
// the "elements" grid should not have any grid columns FROM the original lists
// for grids within grids, show all of them together in one grid, but add a column (or two) giving the name of the parent item(s)
