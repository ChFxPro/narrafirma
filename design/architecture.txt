NarraFirma architecture

The application consists (overall) of "panels".
Some panels are used as "pages" to be displayed.
Some panels are used by widgets (especially the grid widget) to display nested information inside an enclosing panel.

These panels are defined by relatively simple JavaScript modules.
Thes modules are essentially JSON definitions of "field specifications" to include in the panel.
These fields are an array of simple objects.
These objects have these fields:
{
  dataType: "???",
  dataOptions: ["???", "???"],
  displayType: "???",
  displayConfiguration: "???",
  ...
}

These definitions can also often be used to build domain models using the dataType field.
The dataType field can be any of "string", "boolean", "number", or "object".

The panelBuilder package defines a PanelBuilder class that can build a GUI in HTML from these field specifications.
