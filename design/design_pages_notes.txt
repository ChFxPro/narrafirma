// a checkBoxesWithPull is a set of check boxes where the display texts are drawn from a list entered previously 

// a templateList is a list box with templates read in from a file (of a particular type)
// it also has a "copy" button
// if the user chooses a template and presses copy, the fields in the template copy into the fields on the page
// (if there is anything there already there should be a confirmation dialog)

// a participantStoryForm is the form everyone who comes to the URL can see

// but this page can be seen by anyone (and its data gets stored)
// the page also does NOT show the left-side tabs (they are hidden)

// storyBrowser is a smalltalk-like browser that shows two Q&A on top for filtering,
// then a list of stories, then text+metadata of selected story
// it has two optional buttons ("add to observation" and "add to excerpts") 
// the browser without buttons is shown in the collection process phase while stories are coming in
// the browser with buttons is shown in the catalysis phase when stories are done coming in

// storyThemer is a widget where people look at each story, give it 1-3 themes,
// then merge the themes into smaller numbers of themes
// not sure how this will look yet
// end result will be an ADDITION of a Q&A to the metadata for each story
// the Q&A will show up in the graphs as a multiple-choice question

// graphBrowser shows one graph at a time, with two question select drop-downs to choose which graph to show
// has "add to observation" button

// trendsReport shows text and graphs in report based on top differences in statistical tests
// has "add to observation" button

// clusterSpace is used in catalysis to cluster interpretations
// it is a graphical OR grid way of putting like with like
// the option tells you what is to be clustered

// multiline labels are done by adding lines after the first label line; anything up to the next * or # is read
// help texts are placed after questions (that are not labels). if there is no leading <p> in the help text, it is <p>text</p>
