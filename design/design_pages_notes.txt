You can enter your story elements on the next page.
<ol>
<li>Choose one or two types of story element (characters, situations, values, themes, relationships, motivations, beliefs, conflicts).</li>
<li>For each story, come up with as many answers to that element's question as you can. Write the answers on sticky notes.</li>
<li>The questions are:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Characters: Who is doing things in this story?</li>
	<li>Situations: What is going on in this story?</li>
	<li>Values: What matters to the characters in this story?</li>
	<li>Themes: What is this story about?</li>
	<li>Relationships: How are the characters related in this story?</li>
	<li>Motivations: Why do the characters do what they do in this story?</li>
	<li>Beliefs: What do people believe in this story?</li>
	<li>Conflicts: Who or what stands in opposition in this story?</li>
	</ul>
<li>Once you have answered the question(s) you chose for each story, cluster the sticky notes into groups. Place like with like.</li>
<li>Give each group of sticky notes a name.</li>
<li>Clear a "halo" of space around each group's name.</li>
<li>In the halo, write 2-5 good and bad attributes (advantages and disadvantages, opportunities and dangers) of each group of sticky notes.</li>
<li>Copy or move the new good/bad attributes to a new space. Mix them all together.</li>
<li>Cluster the attributes into groups.</li>
<li>Name the groups. These are your story elements.</li>
<li>You can enter your story elements on the next page.</li>
