// a checkBoxesWithPull is a set of check boxes where the display texts are drawn from a list entered previously

// a templateList is a list box with templates read in from a file (of a particular type)
// it also has a "copy" button
// if the user chooses a template and presses copy, the fields in the template copy into the fields on the page
// (if there is anything there already there should be a confirmation dialog)

// storyThemer is a widget where people look at each story, give it 1-3 themes,
