// Explanations of some of the components used in the project in application panel specifications

// question types are: label, header (bold label), text, textarea, select, radiobuttons, grid, checkboxes,
//                     quizScoreResult, templateList, button,
//                     storyBrowser, report,
//                     observationsList, excerptsList, storyThemer, graphBrowser, trendsReport, clusteringDiagram
// page types are: normal (no specification), popup, recommendationTable

// a button does something when clicked

// a templateList is a list box with templates read in from a file (of a particular type)
// it also has a "copy" button
// if the user chooses a template and presses copy, the fields in the template copy into the fields on the page
// (if there is anything there already there should be a confirmation dialog)

// a participantStoryForm is the form everyone who comes to the URL can see
// normally pages can only be seen by the admin person (how to enforce that? user id and password?)
// but this page can be seen by anyone (and its data gets stored)
// the page also does NOT show the left-side tabs (they are hidden)

// grid widget should have these buttons:
// add item (+ button)
// remove selected item (- button)
// edit button (uses same page as add button, but populates it with existing info)
// move selected item up (up arrow)
// move selected item down (down arrow)
// duplicate item
// if in the grid specification there is no page specified, you cannot add a new item

// storyBrowser is a smalltalk-like browser that shows two Q&A on top for filtering,
// then a list of stories, then text+metadata of selected story
// it has two optional buttons ("add to observation" and "add to excerpts")
// the browser without buttons is shown in the collection process phase while stories are coming in
// the browser with buttons is shown in the catalysis phase when stories are done coming in

// storyThemer is a widget where people look at each story, give it 1-3 themes,
// then merge the themes into smaller numbers of themes
// not sure how this will look yet
// end result will be an ADDITION of a Q&A to the metadata for each story
// the Q&A will show up in the graphs as a multiple-choice question

// graphBrowser shows one graph at a time, with two question select drop-downs to choose which graph to show
// has "add to observation" button

// trendsReport shows text and graphs in report based on top differences in statistical tests
// has "add to observation" button

// clusteringDiagram is used in catalysis to cluster interpretations
// it is a graphical OR grid way of putting like with like
// the option tells you what is to be clustered (in terms of the storage location of the diagram)

// multiline labels are done by adding lines after the first label line; anything up to the next * or # is read
// help texts are placed after questions (that are not labels). if there is no leading <p> in the help text, it is <p>text</p>
