The roadblock was comprised of three Corvettes. There was a sharp corner, then a roadblock next to the cliff. The idea was to make the getaway slow down to a crawl or a stop. The cliff was only 15 feet deep, or maybe 20. The getaway cut the corner hard and plowed their left front wheel right over the windshield of one of the Corvettes, flying off the vehicle and launching it over the guard rail. The vehicle landed and its suspension was destroyed. We then caught the suspect. I did not think this would work, and I was very surprised. The suspect did not sustain any major injuries.",
