This is a WordPress plugin which uses WordPress as an application server for the NarraFirma JavaScript code.

The narrafirma.php code implements a version of the Pointrel20150417 code to handle AJAX calls.
That PHP code will store messages which can defined triples.

The WebContent directory need to be copied into the "narrafirma" directory to build an actual working plugin.
