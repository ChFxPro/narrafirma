This was just a test of using the NarraFirma code as a WordPress plugin.

The contents of the WebContent directory would need to be copied into the "narrafirma" directory.

As of this writing (2015-03-11), no data would be saved or loaded yet.
Also, the images will not show correctly without a couple other minor tweaks 
not in the current codebase as well as copying the image directory elsewhere on the webserver.
