/////////////////////////////////////////////////// REMOVE LATER
*   "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
*   "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully used to test the plugin*. Note that it might work on
    higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
*   Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for
    stable.
 Note that the `readme.txt` of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so
if the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used
for displaying information about the plugin.  In this situation, the only thing considered from the trunk `readme.txt`
is the stable tag pointer.  Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in
your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version
that lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk's `readme.txt` points to the correct stable tag.

    If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where
you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.

Participatory Narrative Inquiry in a box. Gather stories and make sense of challenges and opportunities in your community or organization.

== Description ==

NarraFirma is companion software to the textbook [Working with Stories in Your Community Or Organization: Participatory Narrative
Inquiry](http://www.workingwithstories.org).

Participatory narrative inquiry is an approach in which groups of people participate in gathering and working with 
raw stories of personal experience in order to make sense of complex patterns for better decision making. PNI focuses on 
the profound consideration of values, beliefs, feelings, and perspectives through the recounting and interpretation of 
lived experience.

= What is NarraFirma? =

* It's a checklist. NarraFirma provides practical guidance as you work, with questions for you to answer, 
recommendations based on the conditions you describe, activities that help you make decisions, and just-in-time advice.

* It's a journal. NarraFirma helps you keep careful records about what happened in your project, and it 
gives you places to reflect on what happened. This reminds you to keep learning as you work, and it helps you to 
document your project for future reference.

* It's a kiosk. NarraFirma helps you collect stories, on-line and/or off-line, based on question forms you 
design (with sample questions you can copy). Because story collection is integrated, there is no need to 
export or import data.

* It's a workstation. NarraFirma helps you explore and interpret patterns in your data (stories and answers to 
questions about stories), creating annotated visualizations you can use to make sense of the stories you collected.

= Why choose NarraFirma? =

* It's portable. You can install NarraFirma anywhere, as a WordPress plugin or a Node.js web application. Web hosting 
is inexpensive, popular, and well supported. You can also install NarraFirma on your local computer and use it off-line.
(Whichever installation method you choose, we strongly suggest that you set up SSL security on your web site before collecting 
or entering confidential or important information. Many hosting providers can help you with this task.) 

* It's a team player. With NarraFirma your team can work on projects together in real time without having to hand 
files back and forth. You can plan your project, collect stories, discover patterns, and reflect on what you've 
learned - together.

* It's an open book. NarraFirma is open source software. So if you have a question about how something works, 
you can just look at the source code to find out. If you need the software to do something it can't do, you can 
add new functionality yourself or ask someone else to add it.

* It works in the real world. One NarraFirma installation supports multiple projects, forms, data sets, and reports. 
Why? Because real-life story projects are rarely simple or predictable. So go ahead and make a mess. NarraFirma 
is ready for it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I found out more about participatory narrative inquiry? =

You're in luck! I wrote a 650-page textbook about it. Check it out at [workingwithstories.org](workingwithstories.org).

= Does NarraFirma work for other kinds of surveys and projects? =

Well, it's meant to work mainly with PNI, but if you want to collect stories for some other reason, you could still use
NarraFirma for that. It's pretty flexible.

= What about web security? =

We strongly suggest that you set up any web site on which you intend to install NarraFirma 
with SSL (secure sockets). Your hosting provider should be able to help you do that.

= What can I do to help? =

You can donate, volunteer, and spread the word. Visit [narrafirma.com](narrafirma.com) for details.

CFK ADD THESE

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets 
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png` 
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
