==== PNI Workbook TODO list:

PRIORITY:
- questionsTable working again
- recommendations table working
- make whole planning phase work
- make templates work
- print story form
- styling of nested box in grid

Fix how survey data is collected and stored to seperate multiple stories from participant information
Improve take survey page like with support for seperate pages

Some sort of continue button at bottom of page to progress through steps
Validation of page data as progress through a step

Way to retrieve data about project participant groups
Translation of strings related to page of questions on project participant groups

Support a templateList -- a list box with templates read in from a file (of a particular type) with a "copy" button

Support a participantStoryForm -- the form everyone who comes to the URL can see

Support grid item remove
Support grid item edit
Support grid item duplicate
Support grid item move up or down 

Grid widget option specification to control button availability

Support storyThemer -- a widget where people look at each story, give it 1-3 themes, then merge the themes into smaller numbers of themes

Support graphBrowser "add to observation" button
Support graphBrowser contingency table with statistical results
Support standard deviation and mean for histograms
Support common maximum for multiple histograms

Support trendsReport -- shows text and graphs in report based on top differences in statistical tests,  has "add to observation" button

Support clusterSpace -- used in catalysis to cluster interpretations it is a graphical OR grid way of putting like with like, the option tells you what is to be clustered

Support observationsList -- used to list all the previously made observations

Support recommendationTable

Implement countNumberOfVenuesChosen in domain
Implement startup and shutdown of web data collection in domain buttonClicked
Implement printStoryForm in domain buttonClicked
Implement copyStoryFormURLDuringFinalize in domain buttonClicked
Implement copyStoryFormURLDuringStart in domain buttonClicked

Dynamic pages for collection session records
Dynamic pages for venues
Dynamic pages for sensemaking session plans
Dynamic pages for sensemaking session records
Dynamic pages for project outcomes
Dynamic pages for intervention plans?
Dynamic pages for intervention records?
Disabled or hidden tabs which are enabled as progress
Tabs created for new pages as add participants or session plans or session records

Venues table needs fixing -- one for each participant group
Popup for add item  -- should have better label in title as to what type of thing is added
General notes should go after dashboard for each section
Generate story form for data entry from paper form -- or have it work with story browser to review/add stories
webStoryCollectionEnabled toggle status to turn off seems broken
Catalysis -- story browser needs two buttons that pull up pages to put things in lists: addToObservation:"page_addToObservation";addToExcerpt:"page_addToExcerpt"
Need to be able to select text in existing story to AddToExcerpts
Need to figure out some way to represent RESULTS in observations (story browser queries/results, graphs, statistical tests)
Observations list should not have "add" button, because observations can only be added using "add to observation" button on story browser, graph browser, trends report (but it should have an edit button)
Think more about catalysis part

Better and more consistent approach for translation selections for selects, checkboxes, radiobuttons, and maybe other types
Translate report answers as needed for those types like selections
Tranlation support for survey as distinct from application so two do not potentially collide

Readonly version of checkboxes and radiobutton widgets, used by grid

Improve reports so look nice

Update story browser when load latest stories from server (without need to press Filter button again)

Improve loading and saving of project so can look at versions
Confirm reloading or closing page if have unsaved data
Autosave, perhaps based on time or based on changing pages
Provide GUI feedback when saving project to server
Provide GUI feedback when loading project from server

Improve feedback when there are no project versions or survey results; maybe distinguish between an error and nothing being saved yet

Main Dashboard

Help window displaying HTML instead of alert
Look at all alerts in code and make into nicer GUI feedback
Final review of all strings in code looking for TODO translate items or similar
