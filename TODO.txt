==== NarraFirma to-do list:

H - high priority
M - medium priority
L - low priority
W - wish list

------------- Infrastructure -------------

BUILD
? Remove Lodash dependency (maybe?)

VERSIONING
M Create script or procedure to deal with SVN for WordPress' plugin archive

LOGGING
W Think through logging in the server, perhaps using a library
    Ensure useful server logs are kept
    Fix issue with PNIWorkbookServer.conf that it uses logs directory that is not server-data/logs
W Think through logging in the client, perhaps using a library
    Client application could report errors to server or another service
    Client application could report usage metrics to server or another service
W Support for socket.io to track recently added survey results and whether survey is enabled
W Support for socket.io to replace the need for polling for changes

TRANSLATION
W Translate report answers as needed for those types like selections
W Final review of all strings in code looking for TODO translate items or similar
W Add support for surveys that can be in multiple languages

TESTING
W Unit tests
W Continuous integration server that runs tests

SECURITY
W Hash password when sending from client to server (not strictly needed if use ssh, and without ssh everything is potentially insecure from MITM attacks)

------------- Data storage -------------

POINTREL
W Check time server on startup in server to see if accurate enough when timestamping versions; maybe same for client
W Ensure timestamp for latest triple store messages is being set on server and not client
W Simplify Pointrel system further, like to not have message trace adding so PHP WordPress plugin code can be simpler and quicker
W Simplify Pointrel system further, like to only store triples instead of general arbitrary message objects

QUESTIONS
W Improve how options are specified for questions in question designer rather than use text box
W Make sure that short name IDs entered by user when defining questions are unique among themselves
W Think about issue of including project name in stories and triple a field in relation to backup/restore
W Think about what happens to data if questions change somehow in future versions of the software

GRID
M Implement duplication of items in grid

EXPORT/IMPORT
W Add way to clear out or reset old survey results? Or maybe partition them by survey?

VALIDATION
W Think about validation and how or when or if it should be done
W Validation of page data as progress through a step
W Validation in general when progress through tabs and error reporting
W Validation of text fields for empty
W Validation of text fields for length
W Validation for checkBoxes limited by maximum number of choices as validation error

DATA ENTRY
W Autosave for current textarea or input text based on timer even if you don't leave it

------------- Survey system -------------

SURVEY GENERAL
M If logged in, survey should not use "anonymous" user to connect (or should ask)
L All responses for selections (other than sliders) should have unique IDs for each response, and the stored response should have the ID as well as the chosen text at the time.
W Add unique ID so long survey results can be saved as progressed through and finished later if participant has unique ID
W Better mobile support for taking survey on cell phones
W Support uploading of images
W Compliance with accessibility standards
W Only store reference to questionnaire file resource, not the resource itself
W Support translations or other categories for multiple question texts or choice texts for a survey
W Some easy way for two or more survey sliders to be close together under the same label 

SURVEY QUESTIONS
W Ideally way to do conditional question or answer (piping), especially to pick participant group
W Need "other" field for radiobuttons and checkboxes (maybe dropdown, probably not)
W Survey - add checkbox for "is question answer required"
W Survey - start page required (what to do if nothing entered)
W Survey - improve styling on radio buttons for question or alternative approach 
W Survey - back button in browser -- deal with so don't lose data

------------- PNI phases -------------

PLANNING

COLLECTION
L In general, size graphs better based on window size 
W Add support for providing story browser filter options based on analyzing data from surveys to collect all actual choices as well as current questionnaire(s)
W Remember previous filtering options for any question in story browser
W Story list using dgrid with accordion for story
W Add templates for annotation questions (re-add "Copy a question from a template" button, removed in commit 2dde70086198417d2d005e3a6707045c18823d22 2015-09-20 19:09:57)

CATALYSIS
W Need a flip axis for slider for catalysis when graphing? 
W Support common maximum for multiple histograms 
W Support multiple item selection in clustering diagram
W Show percentages for question answers in title hover over questions in catalysis report configuration --> not important
W Support storyThemer -- a widget where people look at each story, give it 1-3 themes, then merge the themes into smaller numbers of themes --> yes but time consuming
W Support an excerpt list somehow --> copy and paste from story list is good enough
W Need to be able to select text in existing story to AddToExcerpts
W Support storiesList -- for choosing a resonant story

SENSEMAKING

INTERVENTION
W One project outcome item created per participant group

RETURN

------------- Project management -------------

GENERAL
W Support Undo (including multi-user aspects with log)
W User should be able to duplicate a project

CONFIGURATION
? Add project configuration page?

------------- User interface -------------

USABILITY
W Improve dashboards, perhaps with checkmarks and thinking through completion feedback to be better
W Support checkBoxesWithPull -- a set of check boxes where the display texts are drawn from a list entered previously (like for participant list)

MULTI USER
W Support mult-user chat
W Notify user of multi-user edit conflicts

ALERTS / MESSAGES
W Look at all alerts in code and make into nicer GUI feedback
M Report when a project can't be read by the current user even if the survey can be read (fix limitation of lumping permissions)
M Improve reporting on startup for loading project data with some kind of progress indicator or remaining count
M When import story form, hundreds of triples can be generated which take minutes to send to the server (with no progress feedback, even though done in background) -- may be related to console logging

==== DONE

--- Release 1.2.0

NEW FEATURES
DONE Added "filter" to create catalysis report and story cards using subset of stories based on answer(s) to question
DONE Added option to print catalysis report with observations only (for group catalysis workshop) and with only particular strengths
DONE Improved catalysis report with links to observations as well as interpretations for each perspective (sorted by strength)
DONE Added method to reset (empty) project and clear out old data to reduce size loaded into memory (important when importing data)
DONE Added ability to hide graphs with few stories (applies to multiple histograms/scatterplots only)
DONE Added ability to save catalysis report graphs in SVG format (better resolution and can be styled with CSS)
DONE Import: Added options for indexed single choice; delimited multi-choice (one column, by name or index); yes/no multi-choice options (multiple columns)
DONE Import: Added many new options to (in most cases) remove need to edit data file before import
DONE Import: Made it possible to edit all import options in NarraFirma itself (no longer need to write CSV story form file)
DONE Import: Added verbose data check to make sure story data is being read correctly before stories are imported
DONE Import: Added options to append "more detail" text fields to story and ignore rows with empty or too-short story entries

DONE Fixed bug that created spurious error messages during report generation
DONE Fixed bug in bar graphs for boolean questions (where "no" was being reported as a non-answer)
