==== NarraFirma TODO list:

SURVEY GENERAL
M If logged in, survey should not use "anonymous" user to connect (or should ask)
L Display how many stories and/or survey results have been collected
L Ideally, all responses for selections (other than numerical sliders) should have unique IDs for each response and the stored response should have the ID as well as the chosen text at the time.
    Add support for short names (ids) for all options for survey questions
X Only store reference to questionnaire file resource, not the resource itself [maybe leaving as is?]
X Support translations or other categories for multiple question texts or choice texts for a survey
X Some easy way for two or more survey sliders to be close together under the same label
W Better mobile support for taking survey on cell phones
W User can enter text for (print and web): Please choose a question to which you would like to respond; Please enter your response in the box below; Please give your story a name; Would you like to tell another story; Yes, I'd like to tell another story; About you

SURVEY QUESTIONS
L Remove "What type of question is this?" question from story-eliciting questions page
X Survey - add checkbox for "is question answer required" (maybe later)
X Survey - start page required (what do do if nothing entered)
X Survey - improve styling on radio buttons for question or alternative approach (maybe later)
X Survey - maximum number stories (maybe later)
X Survey - back button in browser -- deal with so don't lose data

IDs
X Improve how options are specified for questions in question designer rather than use text box
X Make sure that short name IDs entered by user when defining questions are unique among themselves

EXPORT/IMPORT
X Add way to clear out or reset old survey results? Or maybe partition them by survey?

LOGGING
X Think through logging in the server, perhaps using a library
    Ensure useful server logs are kept
    Fix issue with PNIWorkbookServer.conf that it uses logs directory that is not server-data/logs
X Think through logging in the client, perhaps using a library
    Client application could report errors to server or another service
    Client application could report usage metrics to server or another service

STORY THEMER
X Support storyThemer -- a widget where people look at each story, give it 1-3 themes, then merge the themes into smaller numbers of themes
X Page to enter themes for stories
X Page to cluster themes into final themes

STORY CARDS
M Select questions for printing story cards
M Select story positioning and visibility for printing story cards
M Select title positioning and visibility for printing story cards

GRAPH BROWSER
M Test all statistical tests for validity more -- run same tests in spreadsheet on same data
M Support multiple scatter plots across individual question answers
M Sometimes labels at bottom of graph overlap if many items in a scatter plot
M Should mutiple histograms perhap have stats calculated between them even if checkboxes?
L For multiple histograms, the "N/A (checkboxes)" should have a blank line above it
L In general, size graphs better based on window size
L Support graphBrowser common maximum for multiple histograms

PATTERN EXPLORER
L Show number of intepretations in table in PatternExplorer

CLUSTERING (CATALYSIS)

CATALYSIS REPORT
M Support multiple scatter plots per nominal question
M For P=0.000 maybe show < somehow as in p<0.001
M Improve look of catalysis report
M Test that catalysis report can be reliably imported in Word using the inline images or from intermediate PDF doc printed on Mac
M Show percentages for question answers in title hover over questions in catalysis report configuration

CATALYSIS
M Support an excerpt list somehow
X Need to be able to select text in existing story to AddToExcerpts
X Support storiesList -- for choosing a resonant story

SENSEMAKING

RETURN

GRID
L Add close button to top of item panel
L Better information about what is going on in item panel - whether view, edit, duplicate
L When duplicate list item, add "copy" to name (different for each)

CONFIGURATION
? Add project configuration page?

ALERTS
X Look at all alerts in code and make into nicer GUI feedback

TRANSLATION
X Translate report answers as needed for those types like selections
X Final review of all strings in code looking for TODO translate items or similar

BUILD
Remove Lodash dependency (maybe?)

VALIDATION
X Think about validation and how or when or if it should be done
X Validation of page data as progress through a step
X Validation in general when progress through tabs and error reporting
X Validation of text fields for empty
X Validation of text fields for length
X Validation for checkBoxes limited by maximum number of choices as validation error

PRINTING
X Print section reports as HTML

NAVIGATION
L Way to select a different project to switch to (other than editing the URL or logging out)

GENERAL
M Report when a project can't be read by the current user even if the survey can be read (fix limitation of lumping permissions)
M Create script or procedure to deal with SVN for WordPress' plugin archive
M When a Grid item is added but no data is entered like for a catalysis report, the entry in a select looks wrong
M Display total count of all answers when displaying question name in Story Browser
M Improve reporting on startup for loading project data with some kind of progress indicator or remaining count
M Put a copy of install help from NarraFirma website into source tree as a README file 
L Text search function (at least for stories)

COMMUNICATIONS
M When import story form, hundreds of triples can be generated which take minutes to send to the server (with no progress feedback, even though done in background) -- may be related to console logging

UNSURE
X Way to retrieve data about project participant groups [Is this still relevant? Probably yes, if we did "checkboxes with pull" for picking what groups an activity applies to instead of text entry]

======= CYNTHIA

L Fix CSS styling so reminder section of page is different
L Improve general CSS styling on all pages (forms)
X Forgot to put "memorable" in eliciting question types ("What type of question is this?")

THINGS CYNTHIA NOTICED DURING PROJECT
W When make story form, need way to copy all questions of a type into form
W Ideally way to do conditional question or answer (piping), especially to pick participant group
W If entering a story and decide not to, can't remove window without adding story. (But seems to work during local test using "CLose" button)
W After enter story in story thing, form contents don't change (in noticeable way). Rest of form looks the same and no indication. Maybe could improve somehow (like clear). Different needs for data entry -- want to clear and enter new one.
W Need "other" field for radiobuttons and checkboxes (maybe dropdown, probably not)
W Sliders
  Need "does not apply" for sliders
  Sliders too tiny (hard to see color) 
  Need to jiggle slider button or it records nothing (needs work)
  Need a flip axis for slider for catalysis when graphing

THINGS CYNTHIA NOTICED WHILE DOING HELP (probably redundant but just in case)
M Slider should have a "does not apply" option
L After you enter a story, it shows an alert that the story has been saved, but it doesn't get rid of the window. the popup window should go away
L would like to make "focus rectangle" or "rubber band" over graphs when selecting - see http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1667367

==== Wish list:

Think about issue of including project name in stories and triple a field in realation to backup/restore

Add templates for annotation questions and re-add button removed in commit 2dde70086198417d2d005e3a6707045c18823d22 2015-09-20 19:09:57

Recommendation button has different shape than others

Ensure timestamp for latest triple store messages is being set on server and not client
Simplify Pointrel system further, like to not have message trace adding so PHP WordPress plugin code can be simpler and quicker
Simplify Pointrel system further, like to only store triples instead of general arbitrary message objects

Autosave for current textarea or input text based on timer even if you don't leave it

Maybe have a summary page at end of each section (where they put in final notes on that phase)
Generate HTML reports that can be downloaded
Maybe replace reports with one page to export report (or export data)

Support Undo (including multi-user aspects with log)
Support mult-user chat
Notify user of multi-user edit conflicts

Copy selected stories to clipboard and/or a popup window

Display list of selected stories in spot-checking graph browser in Collection section

Support multiple item selection in clustering diagram

Improve look of login and start pages generated by Node.js server
Application should have better support when you need to re-authenticate due to server restart (rather than opening different browser tab by hand)

User can duplicate a project
User can delete a project

Think about what happens to data if questions change somehow in future versions of the software

Improve dashboards, perhaps with green checkmarks and thinking through completion feedback to be better

Support for socket.io to track recently added survey results and whether survey is enabled
Support for socket.io to replace the need for polling for changes

Add support for surveys that can be in multiple languages
Add support for providing story browser filter options based on analyzing data from surveys to collect all actual choices as well as current questionnaire(s)

Remember previous filtering options for any question in story browser

Better font size, maybe user adjustable

User definable CSS themes for surveys

Unit tests

Continuous integration server that runs tests

Generate PDF reports

Hash password when sending from client to server (not strictly needed if use ssh, and without ssh everything is potentially insecure from MITM attacks)

==== Might not do

Story list using dgrid with accordion for story
Support checkBoxesWithPull -- a set of check boxes where the display texts are drawn from a list entered previously (like for participant list)

One project outcome item created per participant group

Check time server on startup in server to see if accurate enough when timestamping versions; maybe same for client

Survey - maybe add unique ID so long survey results can be saved as progressed through and finished later if you have the unique ID....

Support imageUploader
Support storyBrowserCount
