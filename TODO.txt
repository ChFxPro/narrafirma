Support a templateList -- a list box with templates read in from a file (of a particular type) with a "copy" button
Support a participantStoryForm -- the form everyone who comes to the URL can see
Support grid widget with various buttons (add, remove, edit, move up/down, duplicate)
Grid widget option specification to control button availability
Support storyThemer -- a widget where people look at each story, give it 1-3 themes, then merge the themes into smaller numbers of themes
Support graphBrowser -- shows one graph at a time, with two question select drop-downs to choose which graph to show, has "add to observation" button
Support trendsReport -- shows text and graphs in report based on top differences in statistical tests,  has "add to observation" button
Support clusterSpace -- used in catalysis to cluster interpretations it is a graphical OR grid way of putting like with like, the option tells you what is to be clustered
