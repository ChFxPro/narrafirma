==== PNI Workbook TODO list:

PRIORITY:
- recommendations table working
- make whole planning phase work
- print story form
- styling of nested box in grid

Support recommendationTable

Fix how templates are not splitting up options separated by semicolons
Fix how templates list popup has too much scrolling and is not sized well; perhaps start with grid item view pane open?

Fix how selected eliciting question in select box is not entirely visible
Support adding more than one story in survey form GUI
Remove redundant code when calculating survey questions for story and name in survey and story browser

Fix how story browser browses stories for separation of participant info from stories
Should there be a separate participant info browser or is that handled by story browser? If "story browser" does that, may need to rename story browser?
Fix how graph browser shows graphs for separation of participant info from stories

Add support for short names (ids) for eliciting questions
Add support for short names (ids) for all options for survey questions
Improve how options are specified for questions in question designer rather than use text box

Figure out what URLs will look like for administration/authoring vs. survey taking (multiple?) vs. (maybe) project
Settle on some authentication approach for authoring/administration
Figure out GUI for "finalizing" a survey as opposed to storing current version when enable survey
Have survey page use special server method so does not use Pointrel system directly or need authentication
Record IP address of survey or use another means to see if someone taking it multiple times
Ensure the survey taking app does no need to load entire domain from project editor app or load grid or story browser or other modules it does not really need.

Think through how project is loaded and saved, especially what happens if multiple windows or users edit the same project

Think through logging in the server, perhaps using a library
Ensure useful server logs are kept
Fix issue with PNIWorkbookServer.conf that it uses logs directory that is not server-data/logs
Think through logging in the client, perhaps using a library
Client application could report errors to server or another service
Client application could report usage metrics to server or another service

Implement printStoryForm in domain buttonClicked (what do do about entering multiple stories?)

Improve template list generation tool to support storyCollectionActivities and sensemakingActivities

Support storyThemer -- a widget where people look at each story, give it 1-3 themes, then merge the themes into smaller numbers of themes

Support graphBrowser "add to observation" button
Support graphBrowser contingency table with statistical results
Support graphBrowser standard deviation and mean for histograms
Support graphBrowser common maximum for multiple histograms
Support graphBrowser displaying related stories for visible data point or bar or line

Support trendsReport -- shows text and graphs in report based on top differences in statistical tests,  has "add to observation" button

Support clusterSpace -- used in catalysis to cluster interpretations it is a graphical OR grid way of putting like with like, the option tells you what is to be clustered

Support observationsList -- used to list all the previously made observations

Implement exportPresentationOutline in domain buttonClicked

Venues table needs fixing -- one for each participant group
Should "venues" name be changed, as could be confusing as to meaning "location"? But "venue" can also mean "forum" or "soapbox" so maybe OK?

General notes should go after dashboard for each section

Catalysis -- story browser needs two buttons that pull up pages to put things in lists: addToObservation:"page_addToObservation";addToExcerpt:"page_addToExcerpt"
Need to be able to select text in existing story to AddToExcerpts
Need to figure out some way to represent RESULTS in observations (story browser queries/results, graphs, statistical tests)
Observations list should not have "add" button, because observations can only be added using "add to observation" button on story browser, graph browser, trends report (but it should have an edit button)
Support accumulatedItemsGrid -- for results selected to include in an observation
Support annotationsGrid -- for results, excerpts, or interpretations linked to a perspective
Support storiesList -- for choosing a resonant story
Think more about catalysis part

When viewing grid data, it should not look editable
Readonly version of checkboxes and radiobutton widgets, used by grid (assuming that is how the read only data is presented)
Popup for add item from grid -- should have better label in title as to what type of thing is added

Improve reports so look nice

Update story browser when load latest stories from server (without need to press Filter button again)

Improve loading and saving of project so can look at versions
Confirm reloading or closing page if have unsaved data
Autosave, perhaps based on time or based on changing pages

Improve feedback when there are no project versions or survey results; maybe distinguish between an error and nothing being saved yet

Make sure that short name IDs entered by user when defining questions are unique among themselves and don't have a leading underscore (or at least aren't "_id")
Ensure short name IDs entered by user do not conflict with automatically created ones or story text and story name

Main Dashboard
Decide or distinguish between between an initial explanation page versus a first big dashboard
Implement countNumberOfVenuesChosen in domain (is this still needed? If not, remove stub code for it.)

Help window displaying HTML instead of alert
Look at all alerts in code and make into nicer GUI feedback

Figure out how to save and load concept map more directly than with a button to save

For all dialogs, look into probable memory leak when closed and they are not destroyed; see conceptMap for an approach that works to clear them

Better and more consistent approach for translation selections for selects, checkboxes, radiobuttons, and maybe other types
Translate report answers as needed for those types like selections
Final review of all strings in code looking for TODO translate items or similar

Support imageUploader
Support storyBrowserCount

Way to retrieve data about project participant groups [Is this still relevant?]
Implement showHideCollectedStories in domain buttonClicked [Not sure what this means now or if still relevant]

No short name for type: storyThemer field: themeStories text: Theme stories

No short name for type: observationsList field: observationsListChoose text: Choose an observation from this list to which to add the selected result, or create a new observation.
