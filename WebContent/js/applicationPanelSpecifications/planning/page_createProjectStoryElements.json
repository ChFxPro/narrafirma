Write the answers on sticky notes.</li>\n<li>The questions are:</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Characters: Who is doing things in this story?</li>\n<li>Situations: What is going on in this story?</li>\n<li>Values: What matters to the characters in this story?</li>\n<li>Themes: What is this story about?</li>\n<li>Relationships: How are the characters related in this story?</li>\n<li>Motivations: Why do the characters do what they do in this story?</li>\n<li>Beliefs: What do people believe in this story?</li>\n<li>Conflicts: Who or what stands in opposition in this story?</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Once you have answered the question(s) you chose for each story, cluster the sticky notes into groups. Place like with like.</li>\n<li>Give each group of sticky notes a name.</li>\n<li>Clear a \"halo\" of space around each group's name.</li>\n<li>In the halo, write 2-5 good and bad attributes (advantages and disadvantages, opportunities and dangers) of each group of sticky notes.</li>\n<li>Copy or move the new good/bad attributes to a new space. Mix them all together.</li>\n<li>Cluster the attributes into groups.</li>\n<li>Name the groups. These are your story elements.</li>\n<li>You can enter your story elements on the next page.</li>\n</ol>"
