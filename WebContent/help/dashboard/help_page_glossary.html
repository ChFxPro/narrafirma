<p>
Participatory narrative inquiry (PNI) is an approach in which groups of people participate in gathering and working with raw stories of personal experience in order to make sense of complex situations for better decision making. PNI focuses on the profound consideration of values, beliefs, feelings, and perspectives through the
recounting and interpretation of lived experience. PNI draws on theory and practice in narrative inquiry, participatory action research, oral history, mixed-methods research, participatory theatre, narrative therapy, sensemaking, complexity theory, and decision support.
</p>
My textbook, <em>Working with Stories in Your Community or Organization: Participatory Narrative Inquiry</em>,
explains how to conduct PNI projects. You can find <em>Working with Stories</em> at 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Working-Stories-Your-Community-Organization/dp/0991369408">amazon.com</a> 
and at the book's <a href="http://www.workingwithstories.org">web site</a>.

<p>
A phase is the same thing as a step or section or part. I like to call the part of PNI "phases" because they don't always proceed in a step-wise fashion. A project might have a very long collection phase and a short sensemaking phase, or a project might have three collection phases, or a project might be mostly intervention. Few projects flow in simple ways.
