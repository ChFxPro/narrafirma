<p>
The NarraFirma home page is the main page of your project. The triangle diagram describes a typical <a href="help_page_glossary.html#PNI">participatory narrative inquiry</a> (PNI) project, with its three essential <a href="help_page_glossary.html#phase">phases</a> (in the triangle) and its three optional phases (outside the triangle). 
</p>
</div>

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
From NarraFirma's home page you can navigate to all phases of your participatory narrative inquiry (PNI) project. Click on the labeled boxes on the diagram (or on the buttons with the same names) to go to each phase of the project. 
</p>
<p>
You can do the same thing here in the (parallel) help system. Use this diagram to get to the help pages for each phase (<a href="../planning/help_page_planning.html">Planning</a>, <a href="../collection/help_page_collection.html">Collection</a>, <a href="../catalysis/help_page_catalysis.html">Catalysis</a>, <a href="../sensemaking/help_page_sensemaking.html">Sensemaking</a>, <a href="../intervention/help_page_intervention.html">Intervention</a>, and <a href="../return/help_page_return.html">Return</a>).
<p>
You can return to NarraFirma's home page at any time. Just click the Home link at the top of any NarraFirma page in your project.

<div class="heading">Frequently-asked questions</div>

<div class="question">
Where do I put the stories?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
On the NarraFirma home page, click the <a href="../collection/help_page_collection.html">Collection</a> icon (or button). There you can collect stories over the internet or enter them by hand (from interviews or group story sessions). You'll need to create a <a href="CFK">questionnaire</a> first. Questionnaires include questions that <a href="CFK">elicit</a> stories and questions <a href="CFK">about</a> stories. NarraFirma supports <a href="CFK">mixed-methods research</a>, which means that you'll be looking both at the stories and at (counts of) answers to questions about them.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
Where do I get the report?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
NarraFirma has three kinds of report:</p>
<ol>
<li>a <a href="../catalysis/help_page_catalysis.html">catalysis report</a>, which NarraFirma helps you build, whose purpose is to help people make sense of patterns in the data (stories and answers) you've collected</li>
<li>a <a href="../return/help_page_prepareProjectPresentation.html">project presentation</a>, which NarraFirma helps you create, whose purpose is to help you explain the project to people after it's over</li>
<li>a <a href="CFK">project report</a>, which NarraFirma creates for you, whose purpose is to simply record everything you entered for the project for future reference (outside of NarraFirma)</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="question">
Does NarraFirma work only with story data?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
NarraFirma was designed to be used with stories. The stories can be brief anecdotes &mdash; in fact, that's usually the case. But in order for NarraFirma to work well for you, you do need to ask people to tell you <em>what happened</em> to them. If you don't have stories, you can use a variety of other software to collect and analyze data.

<div class="question">
I have more general questions about NarraFirma and its uses. (Or, I found a bug in NarraFirma. Or, I have a suggestion about NarraFirma.)
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
Please visit the NarraFirma <a href="http://www.narrafirma.com">web site</a>, which has a general 
<a href="http://www.narrafirma.com/support">support</a> page, with a link to the bug-reporting and question-asking forum, and a frequently-asked questions list (about the software in general).
