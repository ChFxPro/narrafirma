In the return phase of a PNI project, what has been gathered and produced in the first two essential phases (collection and sensemaking) is returned to the community and enters into collective discourse. Such a return may include formal reports and communications, and it may involve a wide or narrow distribution of collected stories. But it is also likely to include informal story exchanges about peopleâ€™s experiences surrounding the project. These informal storytellings may be more influential than the formal outputs, for better or worse, and they merit attention on their own terms. <em>All PNI projects involve someone telling stories they would not have told before the project took place</em>. 
Whether this is a
stated goal of the project or not, it always happens, because the project is itself a story that takes place in the community. Conscious attention to the return phase is a mark of projects that have lasting positive impacts.
