<div class="heading">What this NarraFirma page is for</div>
<div class="text">
<p>
The Planning page does two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>it links to the pages of the planning phase of your project</li>
<li>it brings together all of the reminders you wrote (to help you remember what you have left to do in the planning phase)
</ul>
<p>The NarraFirma pages in the planning phase are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="help_page_projectFacts.html">Enter project facts</a></li>
<li><a href="help_page_planningQuestionsDraft.html">Answer PNI planning questions</a></li>
<li><a href="xx">Describe participant groups</a></li>
<li><a href="xx">Describe your resources</a></li>
<li><a href="xx">Tell project stories</a></li>
<li><a href="xx">Create project story elements</a></li>
<li><a href="xx">Assess story sharing</a></li>
<li><a href="xx">Revise PNI planning questions</a></li>
<li><a href="xx">Write project synopsis</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>

<div class="heading">What to do here</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
You can't really do anything here except review your reminders and follow the links.
</p>

<div class="heading">Questions you might have</div>

<div class="question">
Is the planning phase required?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
No. The planning phase is placed outside the essential PNI triangle. It's an optional activity. It's usually worthwhile, but it's optional. Nothing else in the program depends on it. If you are just "testing the waters" or are doing a very simple project, you can skip this whole part of NarraFirma.
</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
What if I want to do a pilot story collection, to improve my planning?
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
<p>
You can do that, but you'll need to set it up in the <a href="../collection/help_page_collection.html">Collection</a>  phase. Create a questionnaire, and use it online or enter your data by hand. You can even create a pilot <a href="../catalysis/help_page_catalysis.html">catalysis report</a>, then use it in your planning. NarraFirma doesn't have a special "reflect on your pilot story collection" page, but you can incorporate what you learned when you finalize your answers to the PNI planning questions.
