<div id="helpPageName">Planning: Assess story sharing</div>

<div class="helpHeader">Why this page matters</div>
<div class="helpText">
<p>The better you know how people share stories (or don't) in your community or organization,
the better you will be able to plan a project that asks people to share stories. 
</p>
<p>
Nothing depends on this page, and it's entirely optional. Consider it a test of your knowledge. If you can answer
the questions on this page, you have a good grasp of the conditions you will find when you ask people to share stories with you.
If you can't answer these questions, you might need to spend more time learning about your community or organization
before you will be ready to carry out a successful story project.
</p>
</div>

<div class="helpHeader">What to do on this page</div>
<div class="helpText">
<p>
Answer the questions as well as you can based on what you know about your community or organization. </p>
<p>
At the end of the page you will see your score: a portrait of the narrative life of your community or organization.
If the score is low, it doesn't mean you can't do a story project. It just means you might need to adapt your
project to accommodate the way people share stories in your community or organization.
