<div id="helpPageName">Planning: Describe participant groups</div>

<div class="helpHeader">How to complete this page</div>
<div class="helpText">
Think about groups of people whose perspectives might differ in your project. They might see things differently,
or have different amounts of power in the community or organization. If you need to consider groups separately,
enter them here.
</div>

<div class="helpHeader">Why this page matters</div>
<div class="helpText">
The descriptions you enter here will create the recommendations you see on several other pages (story collection venues,
story eliciting questions, questions about stories, questions about participants, story collection sessions, and
sensemaking sessions). By thinking carefully about your participant groups now, you will lay the ground for solid decisions 
later in the project.
</div>

<div class="helpHeader">Questions you might have</div>
<div class="helpSubHeader">
What if I only have one group?
</div>
<div class="helpQuestionText">
Just describe that one group. It's normal to have only one group if your project is simple.
</div>
<div class="helpSubHeader">
What if I can't answer some of the questions?
</div>
<div class="helpQuestionText">
Choose the answer "unknown." (Or do some more preliminary work until you can answer the question.)
