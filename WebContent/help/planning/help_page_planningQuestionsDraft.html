<div id="helpPageName">Planning: Answer PNI Planning Questions</div>

<div class="helpHeader">Why this page matters</div>
<div class="helpText">
When planning a project, it's a good idea to think through several important aspects of the project: its goals,
relationships, focus, range, scope, and emphasis.
Thinking about these things will make it easier to make practical decisions later, like
how and from whom you will collect stories.
</div>

<div class="helpHeader">What to do on this page</div>
<div class="helpText">
Brainstorm answers to each of these questions. Write down anything you like. Don't censor
yourself. This is only your first draft. You will have a chance to refine your answers
later, after you've done some more planning activities.

<div class="helpHeader">Questions you might have</div>
<div class="helpSubHeader">
What do you mean by goals, relations, etc?
</div>
<div class="helpQuestionText">
<ul>
<li>Goals: What the project is for; what will be achieved if it succeeds.</li>
<li>Relations: Who will do what in the project - tell stories, listen to stories, make sense of stories, 
facilitate, and so on.</li>
<li>Focus: The subject matter of the project; its topic.</li>
<li>Range: Varying perspectives that will be juxtaposed, such as those of two groups or two time frames.</li>
<li>Scope: How many stories will be collected; how many questions will be asked; how many sessions will be held; and so on.</li>
<li>Emphasis: Which of the six phases of PNI (planning, collection, catalysis, sensemaking, intervention, return) 
will be most important.</li>
</ul>
