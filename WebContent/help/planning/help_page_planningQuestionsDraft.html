<div class="helpHeader">How to complete this page</div>
<div class="helpText">
Brainstorm answers to each of these questions. Write down anything you like about them, and don't censor
yourself. This is just your first draft of these answers. You will have a chance to refine them
later, after you've done some more planning activities.

<div class="helpHeader">Why this page matters</div>
<div class="helpText">
When planning a new project, it's a good idea to think through several important aspects of the project: its goals,
relationships, focus, range, scope, and emphasis.
If you don't think about these things, you will find it harder to make practical decisions like
how and from whom to collect stories.

<p><b>Goals</b>: What the project is for; what will be achieved if it succeeds.</p>

facilitate, and so on.</p>
<p><b>Focus</b>: The subject matter of the project; its topic.</p>
<p><b>Range</b>: Perspectives that will be juxtaposed, such as those of two groups or two time frames.</p>
<p><b>Scope</b>: How many stories will be collected; how many questions will be asked; how many sessions will be held; and so on.</p>
<p><b>Emphasis</b>: Which of the six phases of PNI (planning, collection, catalysis, sensemaking, intervention, return) 
will be most important.</p>
