<div class="helpHeader">Why this page matters</div>
<div class="helpText">
Your answers to the PNI planning questions constitute a sort of agreement, with your team or just with yourself,
on what your project is about (and what it is <i>not</i> about). You can use these answers as a touchstone to remind yourself
what you are doing and why. You can use them to communicate the intent behind the project with people outside it.
