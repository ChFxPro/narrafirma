<div class="helpHeader">Why this page matters</div>
<div class="helpText">
<p>Thinking about what might happen in your project
is a great way to find out what you want to achieve and what you are afraid might happen. 
Your hopes and fears can guide you in making project plans.
</p>
<p>On the next page (<a href="help_page_createProjectStoryElements.html">Create project story elements</a>) 
you can use your project stories to make sense of your plans. But you need at least
five stories to create story elements!
</p>
</div>

<div class="helpHeader">What to do on this page</div>
<div class="helpText">
<p>Tell some stories about how your project might play out. 
They don't have to be long or complicated. Just choose a scenario and outcome, then think about what might happen.
</p>
<p>The more stories you can tell, the better you can prepare. 
Try to tell at least five stories. Make sure you have at least one excellent, acceptable, and bad outcome. 
</p>
<p>
<i>If you are working in a team</i>: Make sure <i>everybody</i> on the team tells at least one
one excellent, acceptable, and bad outcome story.

<div class="helpHeader">Questions you might have</div>
<div class="helpSubHeader">
What do the scenario types mean?
</div>
<div class="helpQuestionText">
<ul>
<li>
Ask me anything: If you could ask any person any question and would be guaranteed to get an honest 
answer (magically), whom would you ask, and about what? What would happen if you did?
</li>
<li>
Magic ears: If you could overhear anyone talking to anyone at any time 
and in any place, whom would you want to listen to, where, and when? What might happen?
</li>
<li>
Fly on the wall: If you could observe any situation or event, what situation would you want to witness? 
Imagine what would happen if you did.
</li>
<li>
Project aspects: Consider your draft answers to the <a href="xx">PNI planning questions</a>.
Do any of those answers make you think of a possibility you would like to explore with a story?
</li>
<li>
My own scenario type: Think of another way to tell a story about your project.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="helpSubHeader">
What do the outcome types mean?
</div>
