<div class="helpText">
<p>Tell some stories to think about how your project might play out. Choose a scenario and outcome for each story. 
</p>
<p>
Project stories don't have to be long or complicated. Just think about what might happen and take some notes on
it.
</p>
<p>The more stories you can tell yourself, the better you can prepare. 
Try for at least five stories. Make sure you have at least one excellent, acceptable, and bad outcome. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="helpHeader">Why this page matters</div>
<div class="helpText">
<p>Thinking about what might happen in your project
is a great way to find out what you want to achieve and what you are afraid might happen. 
Your hopes and fears can guide you in making project plans.
</p>
<p>On the next page (<a href="help_page_createProjectStoryElements.html">Create project story elements</a>) 
you can use your project stories to make sense of your plans. But you need at least
five stories to do that!

answer (magically), whom would you ask, about what, and why?

Magic ears: If you could overhear anyone talking to anyone at any time 
and in any place, whom would you want to listen to, where and when, and why?
</li>
<li>
Fly on the wall: If you could observe any situation or event, what situation would you want to witness, and why?
</li>
<li>
Project aspects: Consider your draft answers to the <a href="xx">PNI planning questions</a>.
Do any of those answers make you think of a possibility you would like to explore?
